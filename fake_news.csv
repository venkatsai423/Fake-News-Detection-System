"It was not even a month ago that Mayor Bill de Blasio led a boisterous rally in Foley Square to celebrate the passage of key elements of his affordable housing plan. It was meant to be a pivotal moment in Mr. de Blasio‚Äôs tenure, a victory that would position him to better attend to New York City‚Äôs    needs  ‚Äî   something of a requisite as he approaches   next year. In the past two weeks, though, the mayor‚Äôs fortunes have swung wildly in the opposite direction. His ability and style as a manager have come under excruciating scrutiny, as four separate investigative agencies pursue inquiries into possible wrongdoing on the part of his administration. Mr. de Blasio, a Democrat, has been peppered with uncomfortable questions at news conferences and on national television, at a time when he hoped to be acting as a liberal   for Hillary Clinton ahead of New York‚Äôs presidential primary on Tuesday. Instead, the mayor has repeatedly pleaded ignorance about the questionable actions of city agencies, all but undoing recent attempts by close aides to portray him as an adroit manager of a sprawling city bureaucracy that critics initially said he was too inexperienced or too ideological to handle effectively. Despite Mr. de Blasio‚Äôs centralized management style  ‚Äî   marked by memos on key decisions and a desire for City Hall to weigh in on seemingly minor matters  ‚Äî   he has repeatedly said he was left in the dark as problems percolated. And though he has tried to go even deeper into the minutiae of municipal governance, his focus on details, as described by close aides, has not extended to the subjects of the investigations. In March, the city comptroller‚Äôs office opened an inquiry into a   change to a deed that allowed a nursing home on the Lower East Side of Manhattan to be converted to the type of luxury apartments the mayor has said he wants to limit. Mr. de Blasio said he first learned of the matter from news reports. Less than two weeks later, the mayor learned of a federal corruption investigation into top Police Department officials. The inquiry revolved around two of Mr. de Blasio‚Äôs   political supporters and appeared to extend into his   efforts more broadly. Not long after that, the mayor had to explain confusion in his administration over whether work on a crucial water tunnel that would serve Brooklyn and Queens had been delayed. In addition to the federal inquiry and the one by the comptroller, investigations are underway into the nursing home deal by the state attorney general, Eric T. Schneiderman, and the city‚Äôs Investigation Department. Mr. de Blasio, who spent much of his first year as mayor focused on providing universal prekindergarten and much of the second year on his affordable housing initiative, said in an interview last month that he was intent on pressing ahead with an aggressive policy agenda. ‚ÄúWe are going up the ambition scale here,‚Äù he said of his next goals: reducing homelessness, improving mental health services and addressing the dirt and disorder that tarnish the quality of New Yorkers‚Äô lives. The de Blasio administration wants to combine those goals with an effort to overcome the mayor‚Äôs image as a leader more interested in making grand pronouncements than filling potholes. It was a perception shaped by numerous missteps in Mr. de Blasio‚Äôs first two years in office: late arrivals to events, public comments that alienated an already skeptical police force, a feud with Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, his fellow Democrat. That image, which Mr. de Blasio has worked hard to shed, lent credibility to the notion that he could be vulnerable in the 2017 election, with potential challenges from both the right and left. But before the investigations came to light, Mr. de Blasio enjoyed rising popularity in polls, with no prominent Democrat emerging as a serious rival. Now the inquiries  ‚Äî   as well as a   joke the mayor made during a skit he performed with Mrs. Clinton on Saturday  ‚Äî   have put Mr. de Blasio back on his heels. ‚ÄúHe appears to be the type of political leader that those type of allegations accrue to,‚Äù said Don Levy, director of the Siena Research Institute, which conducts political polls. ‚ÄúA few years into his administration, his armor has taken a few hits and his accomplishments at this point just don‚Äôt seem to have turned the tide on a growing narrative of his not being effective. ‚Äù Mr. de Blasio has said he was not immediately informed about a separate federal investigation, also by the United States attorney for the Southern District, Preet Bharara, into the New York City Housing Authority, which began turning over millions of documents last year. Likewise, the mayor said he first heard of the federal corruption investigation involving the donors, Jeremiah Reichberg and Jona S. Rechnitz, from news reports this month. The police commissioner, William J. Bratton, has said the federal authorities told him of the widening investigation in 2014. (At the time, people briefed on the matter have said, the focus was on Philip Banks III, then the   uniformed officer, and Norman Seabrook, the head of the city correction officers‚Äô union.) City officials have said Anthony E. Shorris, the first deputy mayor, knew about the circumstances surrounding the lifting of the deed restriction on the nursing home weeks before the mayor said he became aware. The property was sold to condominium developers for $116 million in February after the Department of Citywide Administrative Services agreed to lift the restriction, which would have prevented the transaction. City officials said Mr. Shorris wanted to understand the matter fully before informing Mr. de Blasio. Two former city officials familiar with City Hall‚Äôs working said the mayor‚Äôs desire to closely manage decisions  ‚Äî   and his displeasure when subordinates failed to answer his detailed questions  ‚Äî   could backfire at times, making agency officials wary of bringing potentially troublesome issues to him in their early stages. One former official said that on several occasions, Mr. de Blasio said he had not been informed about an issue, when there was evidence that he had been, either by email or in person. The mayor would say he had not read the emails, the official said. Both officials, who still work in New York City, requested anonymity to speak about the administration‚Äôs internal operations. ‚ÄúThe mayor is driven and passionate and holds his people accountable,‚Äù said Phil Walzak, a chief adviser to Mr. de Blasio. ‚ÄúPeople want to take information to the mayor when there‚Äôs a problem identified and some recommendations that can be made. I don‚Äôt know that people are reluctant to talk to him. I wouldn‚Äôt agree with that assessment. ‚Äù Mr. Walzak said the investigations had not dampened progress on the mayor‚Äôs agenda. ‚ÄúThe mission of the administration is going to continue forward,‚Äù he said. In recent months, Mr. de Blasio has also moved beyond criticizing the previous administration‚Äôs failures and has begun celebrating the city and a trajectory that he can claim as his own. How far Mr. de Blasio‚Äôs new approach will carry him, as attention remains focused on the investigations, is an open question. In the interview last month, Mr. de Blasio said that he would be personally involved in the planning and execution of what he called ‚Äúnew, prominent efforts,‚Äù attending meetings and making sure that subordinates retained a sense of urgency. ‚ÄúIn any one of these efforts I set the strategic template,‚Äù he said, ‚Äúand that can mean agreeing to a vision, to a set of strategies and tactics that my team develops. ‚Äù But on Monday, as Mr. de Blasio announced changes to how his administration handled homeless people, he faced repeated questions about the investigations and his   practices. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm happy to take questions today, but I‚Äôm not going to be speaking about this after today,‚Äù he said. But two days later, he was answering more questions about the investigations  ‚Äî   and about his skit with Mrs. Clinton  ‚Äî   after an event held by the Rev. Al Sharpton, where she also spoke. ‚ÄúGlad we focused on the important issues of the day,‚Äù he said sarcastically to reporters before walking off.",Foregin,
"US Drone Strike In Afghanistan Kills, Wounds Several Civilians The attack targeted the home of a suspected 'Taliban commander.' | October 29, 2016 Be Sociable, Share! In this July, 2008 photo, a U.S. MQ-9 Reaper takes off from Joint Base Balad, Iraq. (Photo/U.S. Air Force by Tech. Sgt. Richard Lisum via Wikimedia Commons) 
A US drone strike has killed and wounded a number of civilians in Afghanistan‚Äôs Nangarhar Province today, though exact numbers are as yet unclear, with officials claiming that the home at the center of the attack was owned by a suspected Taliban commander. 
The putative commander does not appear to have been among the casualties, though at least four people were killed within the house, and the blast also wounded a number of people in the surrounding area. At least seven children and five women are in the hospital for treatment related to the strike. 
Official Afghan statements only labeled the 12 wounded as civilians, and everyone else was not a civilian. Locals offered varying estimates, and the Taliban claimed two civilians killed and over 30 wounded in their own report on the attack. 
The Nangarhar Province has been heavily targeted by US warplanes over the past several months, though generally trying to tamp down a growing ISIS faction therein. The Taliban has had a presence in Nangarhar throughout the US occupation, as indeed they have almost everywhere along the Pakistan border.",Foregin,
"Bobby Hutcherson, one of the most admired and accomplished vibraphonists in jazz, died on Monday at his home in Montara, Calif. He was 75. Marshall Lamm, a spokesman for Mr. Hutcherson‚Äôs family, confirmed the death, saying Mr. Hutcherson had long been treated for emphysema. Mr. Hutcherson‚Äôs career took flight in the early 1960s, as jazz was slipping free of the complex harmonic and rhythmic designs of bebop. He was fluent in that language, but he was also one of the first to adapt his instrument to a freer postbop language, often playing chords with a pair of mallets in each hand. He released more than 40 albums and appeared on many more, including some regarded as classics, like ‚ÄúOut to Lunch,‚Äù by the alto saxophonist, flutist and bass clarinetist Eric Dolphy, and ‚ÄúMode for Joe,‚Äù by the tenor saxophonist Joe Henderson. Both of those albums were a byproduct of Mr. Hutcherson‚Äôs close affiliation with Blue Note Records, from 1963 to 1977. He was part of a wave of young artists who defined the label‚Äôs forays into experimentalism, including the pianist Andrew Hill and the alto saxophonist Jackie McLean. But he also worked with   stalwarts like the tenor saxophonist Dexter Gordon, and he later delved into   and   grooves. Mr. Hutcherson had a clear, ringing sound, but his style was luminescent and coolly fluid. More than Milt Jackson or Lionel Hampton, his major predecessors on the vibraphone, he made an art out of resonating overtones and chiming decay. This coloristic range of sound, which he often used in the service of emotional expression, was one reason for the deep influence he left on stylistic inheritors like Joe Locke, Warren Wolf, Chris Dingman and Stefon Harris, who recently assessed him as ‚Äúby far the most harmonically advanced person to ever play the vibraphone. ‚Äù Robert Hutcherson was born in Los Angeles on Jan. 17, 1941. His father, Eli, was a brick mason, and his mother, Esther, was a hairdresser. Growing up in a black community in Pasadena, Calif. Mr. Hutcherson was drawn to jazz partly by way of his older siblings: His brother, Teddy, had gone to high school with Mr. Gordon, and his sister, Peggy, was a singer who worked with the Gerald Wilson Orchestra. (She later toured and recorded with Ray Charles as a Raelette.) Mr. Hutcherson, who took piano lessons as a child, often described his transition to vibraphone as the result of an epiphany: Walking past a record store one day, he heard a recording of Milt Jackson and was hooked. A friend at school, the bassist Herbie Lewis, further encouraged his interest in the vibraphone, so Mr. Hutcherson saved up and bought one. He was promptly booked for a concert with Mr. Lewis‚Äôs band. ‚ÄúWell, I hit the first note,‚Äù he recalled of that performance in a 2014 interview with JazzTimes. But, he added, ‚Äúfrom the second note on it was complete chaos. You never heard people boo and laugh like that. I was completely humiliated. But my mom was just smiling, and my father was saying, ‚ÄòSee, I told you he should have been a bricklayer. ‚Äô‚Äù Mr. Hutcherson persevered, eventually working with musicians like Mr. Dolphy, whom he had first met when Mr. Dolphy was his sister‚Äôs boyfriend, and the tenor saxophonist and flutist Charles Lloyd. In 1962, he joined a band led by a pair of Count Basie sidemen, the tenor saxophonist Billy Mitchell and the trombonist Al Grey, and it brought him to New York City for a debut engagement at Birdland. The group broke up not long afterward, but Mr. Hutcherson stayed in New York, driving a taxicab for a living, his vibraphone stashed in the trunk. He was living in the Bronx and married to his high school sweetheart, the former Beth Buford, with whom he had a son, Barry  ‚Äî   the inspiration for his   tune, the lilting modernist waltz ‚ÄúLittle B‚Äôs Poem. ‚Äù Mr. Hutcherson caught a break when Mr. Lewis, his childhood friend, came to town and introduced him to the trombonist Grachan Moncur III, who in turn introduced him to Mr. McLean. ‚ÄúOne Step Beyond,‚Äù an album by Mr. McLean released on Blue Note in 1963, featured Mr. Hutcherson‚Äôs vibraphone as the only chordal instrument. From that point on, he was busy. The first album he released as a leader was ‚ÄúDialogue‚Äù (1965) featuring Mr. Hill, the trumpeter Freddie Hubbard and the saxophonist and flutist Sam Rivers. Among his notable subsequent albums was ‚Äú !‚Äù (1966) with Mr. Henderson and the pianist McCoy Tyner among his partners. He and Mr. Tyner would forge a close alliance. After being arrested for marijuana possession in Central Park in 1967, Mr. Hutcherson lost his cabaret card, required of any musician working in New York clubs. He returned to California and struck a rapport with the tenor saxophonist Harold Land. Among the recordings they made together was ‚ÄúUmmh,‚Äù a funk shuffle that became a crossover hit in 1970. (It was later sampled by the rapper Ice Cube.) In the early ‚Äô70s Mr. Hutcherson bought an acre of land along the coast in Montara, where he built a house. He lived there with his wife, the former Rosemary Zuniga, whom he married in 1972. She survives him, along with their son, Teddy, a marketing production manager for the organization SFJazz his son Barry, a jazz drummer and two grandchildren. After his tenure on Blue Note, Mr. Hutcherson released albums on Columbia, Landmark and other labels, working with Mr. Tyner, the tenor saxophonist Sonny Rollins and  ‚Äî   onscreen, in the 1986 Bertrand Tavernier film ‚ÄúRound Midnight‚Äù  ‚Äî   with Mr. Gordon and the pianist Herbie Hancock. From 2004 to 2007, Mr. Hutcherson toured with the first edition of the SFJazz Collective, an ensemble devoted equally to jazz repertory and the creation of new music. He was named a National Endowment for the Arts Jazz Master in 2010. After releasing a series of albums on the European label Kind of Blue, he returned to Blue Note in 2014 to release a   effort, ‚ÄúEnjoy the View,‚Äù with the alto saxophonist David Sanborn and other collaborators. Speaking in recent years, Mr. Hutcherson was fond of citing a bit of insight from an old friend. ‚ÄúEric Dolphy said music is like the wind,‚Äù he told The San Francisco Chronicle in 2012. ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt know where it came from, and you don‚Äôt know where it went. You can‚Äôt control it. All you can do is get inside the sphere of it and be swept away. ‚Äù",Foregin,

"  advocates have begun boycotting scheduled ‚Äústakeholder‚Äù meetings with immigration agency officials after the officials also invited   reform advocates according to CNN. [‚ÄúWe are frustrated and angry that what [has] felt like a productive conversation and an exchange of ideas and information about how to ensure the safe and fair treatment of immigrants in their [Immigration and Customs Enforcement] custody has morphed into a meeting with organizations whose mission is to restrict immigration,‚Äù one   advocate told CNN.   ‚ÄúImmigrants‚Äô rights organizations have since notified ICE that they have dissolved the   Working Group and will no longer participate in the quarterly gatherings,‚Äù CNN said.  ‚ÄúIt is not a surprise  ‚Äî   they can‚Äôt tolerate anyone there that doesn‚Äôt agree with them‚Äù responded Mark Krikorian, director of the Center for Immigration Studies. ‚ÄúThey figure they owned those meetings and the fact is now that they don‚Äôt, so they‚Äôre having a tantrum. ‚Äù Since the new administration arrived, Krikorian said he was invited to attend one ICE stakeholder meetings with the   groups. ‚ÄúIt was just kind of a general information thing about what‚Äôs going on, what‚Äôs new with regard to ICE [policies on] detention, removal and all that,‚Äù he said.  Immigration advocates mostly ‚Äúsat on one side of the table   ‚Ä¶     we sat on the other side of the table,‚Äù he said, adding ‚Äúone of them even kind of joked about it [although] it was not like there was some kind of icy atmosphere in the room. ‚Äù During the Obama administration, the   groups used the stakeholder meetings to lobby and pressure agencies, and to cooperate on shared goals. In 2010, for example, ICE officials used one of the meetings to ask   groups to collect complaints about ICE‚Äôs actions, according to a posting by a group titled ‚ÄúStop Detaining Immigrants. ‚Äù ICE has informed members of the   Working Group   ‚Ä¶      ICE has asked that NGOs provide to them complaints that we are seeing around the country specifically on issues that demonstrate that IGSA facilities are not currently meeting the baseline requirements   ‚Ä¶      In order to respond to ICEs request for complaints data, we would like to provide examples of violations of detention standards to present a national overview of some of the more egregious violations for the snapshot period of January 1, 2010 to March 2010.

Obama‚Äôs officials at the Department of State ended meetings with the   advocacy groups once the   groups managed to bypass bureaucratic barriers to get into the national and regional meetings, said Ann Corcoran, the director of Refugee Resettlement Watch. In 2016, for example, the main meeting in D. C. was canceled, and opponents of   refugee inflows were allowed only to submit recommendations that were never released, she said.  ‚ÄúThe stakeholder meetings that the refugee industry has [with agency officials] are really keep very secretive,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúThey love to have stakeholder meetings [about refugees] and I‚Äôve never gotten wind of them,‚Äú Krikorian said.  The new boycott against the agencies comes alongside complaints by   groups about the administration‚Äôs hiring of two immigration experts formerly employed at   reform groups. According to CNN: Two   opponents of illegal immigration have obtained   advisory jobs at federal immigration agencies in the Department of Homeland Security. Jon Feere, a former legal policy analyst for the Center for Immigration Studies, or CIS, has been hired as an adviser to Thomas D. Homan, the acting director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, according to Homeland Security spokesman David Lapan. At Customs and Border Protection, Julie Kirchner, the former executive director of the Federation for American Immigration Reform, or FAIR, has been hired as an adviser to Customs and Border Protection acting Commissioner Kevin McAleenan, said Lapan.   advocates protested the appointments, according to CNN:  ‚ÄúThese groups have spent 20 years looking for ways that they could hurt immigrants and now they‚Äôve been given the keys to the kingdom,‚Äù said Lynn Tramonte, deputy director of America‚Äôs Voice, a   advocacy group based in Washington whose goal is to create a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants. The agencies should continue to open up their meetings to all side in the debate, said Krikorian.  ‚ÄúObviously these kinds of information sessions with ICE officials should be open any interested party,‚Äù Krikorian said, adding ‚Äúyou can‚Äôt just grab people off the street, but any organization that works on the immigration issue should be able to come to these meetings. ‚Äù ‚ÄúIt is outrageous that that wasn‚Äôt the case before, and I have to give credit to the agencies,‚Äù Krikorian said.

"Zero Hedge ‚Äì by Tyler Durden 
Project Veritas has just released Part IV of it‚Äôs multi-part series exposing numerous scandals surrounding the DNC and the Clinton campaign, including efforts to incite violence at Trump rallies and, at least what seems to be, illegal coordination between the DNC, Hillary For America and various Super PACs. 
Part IV focuses on a $20,000 foreign donation made by an undercover Project Veritas journalist to Americans United for Change (AUFC). Ironically, shortly after the $20k donation wire was released, the contributor‚Äôs ‚Äúniece‚Äù was offered an internship with Creamer‚Äôs firm, Democracy Partners. 
In the new video, Creamer says: ‚ÄúEvery morning I am on a call at 10:30 that goes over the message being driven by the campaign headquarters ‚Ä¶ I am in this campaign mainly to deal with what earned media with television, radio, with earned media and social media, not with paid media, not with advertising.‚Äù He also mentions a conference call discussing a woman potentially coming forward to accuse Trump of inappropriate behavior. 
Creamer, a seasoned Chicago activist who is married to Rep. Jan Schakowsky (D-IL), whose Republican opponent, Joan McCarthy Lasonde has called for her to resign over her husband‚Äôs activities, also talks about his work with Barack Obama, whom he says he has known since the 1980s, when Obama was a community organizer in Chicago: ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs a pro, I‚Äôve known the President since he was a community organizer in Chicago.‚Äù 
Elsewhere, Creamer adds: ‚ÄúI do a lot of work with the White House on their issues, helping to run issue campaigns that they have been involved in. I mean, for immigration reform for the‚Ä¶ the health care bill, for trying to make America more like Britain when it comes to gun violence issues.‚Äù In the effort to prove the credibility of the undercover donor featured in the videos and to keep the investigation going, Project Veritas Action made the decision to donate twenty thousand dollars to Robert Creamer‚Äôs effort. Project Veritas Action had determined that the benefit of this investigation outweighed the cost. And it did. 
‚ÄúFirst thing, like I said, thank you for the proposal. And I‚Äôd like to get the $20,000 across to you. The second call I‚Äôm going to make here is to my money guy and he‚Äôs going to get in touch with you and auto wire the funds to you,‚Äù said the PVA journalist. 
Creamer told the PVA journalist to send the money to Americans United for Change. Shortly after the money was released, the ‚Äúdonors‚Äù ‚Äúniece‚Äù ‚Äì another Project Veritas Action journalist ‚Äì was offered an internship with Creamer. 
In an effort to see how far Creamer would go with the promise of more money, another Project Veritas journalist posing as the donor‚Äôs money liaison requested a meeting with Creamer. During that meeting, Creamer spoke about connections he had with Obama and Clinton. 
AUFC President, Brad Woodhouse, subsequently returned the money, after Project Veritas started to release their undercover videos, citing ‚Äúconcerns that it might have been an illegal foreign donation.‚Äù Oddly, Woodhouse was not terribly concerned about the ‚Äúlegality‚Äù of the donation when he chose to accept it a month prior. In an unexpected twist, AUFC president Brad Woodhouse, the recipient of the $20,000, heard that Project Veritas Action was releasing undercover videos exposing AUFC‚Äôs activities. He told a journalist that AUFC was going to return the twenty thousand dollars. He said it was because they were concerned that it might have been an illegal foreign donation. Project Veritas Action was pleased but wondered why that hadn‚Äôt been a problem for the month that they had the money. 
While the latest video focuses on the ‚Äú $20,000 illegal foreign contribution‚Äù from an undercover Project Veritas journalist , the following comments from Robert Creamer were also rather intriguing in light of recent White House efforts to vehemently deny any connections between he and President Obama. ‚ÄúOh Barack Obama‚Äôs was the best campaign in the history of American politics, I mean the second one, I mean the first was good too. I was a consultant to both, the second one, was everything hit on every level and every aspect. 
He‚Äôs a pro. I‚Äôve known the President since he was a community organizer in Chicago. 
I was just at and event with him in Chicago actually, on Friday last. He is just as good as ever. I do a lot of work with the White House on their issues. Helping to run issued campaigns that they have been involved in. I mean, for immigration reform for the‚Ä¶the health care bill‚Ä¶trying to make America more like Britain when it comes to gun violence issues.‚Äù

"  lady Michelle Obama is calling into question the ‚Äúmotives‚Äù of those who oppose her bland, tasteless, and universally hated school lunch rules, insisting that those who oppose her ideas don‚Äôt care about kids and don‚Äôt mind if they ‚Äúeat crap. ‚Äù[Speaking at the annual Partnership for a Healthier America conference, Michelle Obama responded with venom to critics of her school lunch program.  Warming to her reply, Mrs. Obama slammed anyone who stood against her policy and characterized critics as people who don‚Äôt want kids to be healthy. Michelle Obama criticizes Trump administration‚Äôs decision on school lunch rules: ‚ÄúThink about why someone is OK with your kids eating crap. ‚Äù pic. twitter.   ‚Äî   Bradd Jaffy (@BraddJaffy) May 12, 2017,  Saying, ‚ÄúThis is where you have to look at motives,‚Äù Obama also hinted that she felt the only reason people opposed her nutrition rules is because people opposed her husband on a political level. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not politics, it‚Äôs parenting,‚Äù she insisted. ‚ÄúYou have to stop and think, ‚ÄòWhy don‚Äôt you want our kids to have good food at school? What is wrong with you and why is that a partisan issue?‚Äù Obama said. ‚ÄúWhy would that be political?‚Äù ‚ÄúMoms, think about this. I don‚Äôt care what state you live in, take me out of the equation, like me, don‚Äôt like me, but think about why someone is OK with your kids eating crap,‚Äù the former first lady continued. ‚ÄúBecause here‚Äôs the secret: If somebody is doing that, they don‚Äôt care about your kid, and we need to demand everyone to care deeply about our kids,‚Äù Obama exclaimed. ‚ÄúEvery elected official on this planet should understand, don‚Äôt play with our children, don‚Äôt do it,‚Äù she concluded. Nowhere in the discussion did Obama note that it is the role of parents to guide their children‚Äôs eating habits, not that of the government. In another part of her appearance, Obama ran contrary to the penchant of liberals who constantly insist that children should be given the same   power as adults. At one point, Michelle Obama claimed that kids should not have any say in the foods they eat at school. ‚ÄúHow about we stop asking kids how they feel about their food? Kids, my kids included, if they could eat pizza and french fries every day with ice cream on top and a soda, they would think they were happy until they got sick,‚Äù she said during the session. ‚ÄúThat to me is one of the most ridiculous things we talk about in this movement, that the kids aren‚Äôt happy. Well, you know what? Kids don‚Äôt like math, either. So what are we going to do, stop teaching math? We gonna cut history out because there are kids who are bored with history? We are the adults in the room, you know? They look to us. So let‚Äôs just stop with that. I‚Äôm good if kids are mad at me,‚Äù she concluded. Obama is unhappy that the Trump administration has begun the process of rolling back the unappetizing food restrictions the former first lady put into place during her husband‚Äôs tenure in the White House. Late last month, U. S. Secretary of Agriculture Sonny Perdue began easing some of the restrictions Obama worked to enforce in school lunch programs throughout the country. Perdue put in place an interim rule for the   school year that suspended Obama‚Äôs requirements for sodium reduction and whole grains. The new rules also once again permitted   flavored milk in school cafeterias. Follow Warner Todd Huston on Twitter @warnerthuston or email the author at igcolonel@hotmail. com.",Foregin,
"JUBA, South Sudan  ‚Äî   South Sudan slid rapidly closer to war on Monday as helicopter gunships pounded targets, two United Nations peacekeepers were killed, foreign governments scrambled to get their citizens out and worries grew about the fate of civilians trapped in crowded displaced persons camps. Gunfire rang out from different quarters, moving across Juba, the capital, like a thunderstorm, on and off, and witnesses said hundreds of people had been killed in the past three days. The fighting completely overshadowed the fifth anniversary this weekend of the country‚Äôs independence. In Juba, few celebrated because people were hunkered down indoors. South Sudan, the world‚Äôs youngest country and one of its poorest, cracked open into civil war in December 2013 after the nation‚Äôs two top politicians, President Salva Kiir and Vice President Riek Machar, bitterly split. Mr. Machar became the leader of a rebel group, and an estimated 50, 000 people have been killed since then. Each side has been blamed for widespread atrocities against civilians. But after a peace agreement, Mr. Machar returned to Juba in April and was sworn into his old position as Mr. Kiir‚Äôs vice president, essentially returning the country to the fragile political situation it was in before the war. The latest violence seems to be fueled by the same rivalry between the two men, who are from different ethnic groups and have tens of thousands of heavily armed young men following them. But there are also worries that the top leaders are losing control over their troops. ‚ÄúIn the last 2 hrs, we went through heavy bombardments by Pres Kiir helicopters,‚Äù Mr. Machar wrote on Twitter on Monday. ‚ÄúThis tells that our partner is not interested in peace. ‚Äù On Monday, United Nations officials said that the large displaced persons camps in and around Juba that house thousands of people had been shelled, killing at least two civilians and wounding dozens. It was not clear if the mortar or artillery shells that had crashed into the camps were stray shots or were deliberately aimed at civilians seeking refuge. United Nations officials said they were deeply concerned and were trying to secure the camps as best as possible. Mr. Kiir‚Äôs spokesman read a statement signed by the president calling for a unilateral   beginning at 6 p. m. local time, and he urged Mr. Machar to tell his fighters to stand down as well. ‚ÄúThis is a unilateral ‚Äù said the spokesman, Ateny Wek Ateny. ‚ÄúThe president has declared, and is also urging the leader of the former rebel movement, Dr. Riek, who is still the first vice president of the republic of South Sudan, to also do the same and cease the hostilities. ‚Äù More than 10, 000 people may have been displaced by the latest fighting, the United Nations said, adding to the 30, 000 or so people who fled their homes during previous rounds of violence in Juba. On Monday, the maternity wing of a hospital run by the International Medical Corps was hit by shelling, the group said in a statement, adding that it had treated 139 people since July 8 for injuries inside what is supposed to be a protected area. Secretary General Ban   called on Monday for an ‚Äúimmediate arms embargo‚Äù against South Sudan, saying that its rival leaders had ‚Äúmade a mockery‚Äù of the peace deal they signed only months ago. The ball is now in the Security Council‚Äôs court. The United States and China, the two countries with the greatest stakes in the country, have been lukewarm to the idea of an arms embargo in the past. A group of African nations on Monday nudged the Security Council to strengthen the mandate of the peacekeeping mission, in part by sending in more troops from the region and by creating what it called an ‚Äúintervention brigade. ‚Äù He also called for the peacekeeping mission to be reinforced. There are 12, 000 soldiers and police officers on the ground now. Mr. Ban said government troops had effectively been blocked from leaving their bases. Contingency plans are being explored to bring in more peacekeepers from the neighboring Democratic Republic of Congo, United Nations officials said Monday. The displaced persons camps are considered to be in danger. Thousands of people, mostly members of Mr. Machar‚Äôs ethnic group, the Nuer, are concentrated in rows of tents, easy targets for artillery. Many fled their homes in the past two years to escape ethnically targeted violence. Human rights groups say the violence between Nuer soldiers and those of the Dinka, Mr. Kiir‚Äôs group, has spawned a range of atrocities, including mass rape and the widespread killing of civilians. One senior Western official, who was not authorized to speak publicly, said the South Sudanese government was accusing Mr. Machar‚Äôs rebel forces of hiding in the displaced persons camps, which could be used as a pretext to storm them. The United States Embassy posted on its Facebook page: ‚ÄúThe situation in Juba has significantly deteriorated. There is serious ongoing fighting between government and opposition forces, including near the airport, Unmiss locations, Jebel and elsewhere throughout Juba. ‚Äù (Unmiss is the acronym for the United Nations Mission in South Sudan.) The United States government is preparing to evacuate personnel from its embassy in Juba. Last week, when the fighting started, an American government car was sprayed by gunfire. The car was heavily armored, and no American employees were believed to have been hurt. In several past emergencies, United Nations peacekeepers in South Sudan have been outnumbered and did not stop massacres. In February, dozens of civilians were killed when soldiers overran a United Nations camp in Malakal, in the eastern part of the country. The two peacekeepers who were killed in the latest round of violence were believed to be Chinese. One was killed while sitting in an armored personnel carrier that was trying to protect a displaced persons camp. South Sudan‚Äôs recent history has been soaked in blood. Aid workers estimate that at least two million people have been killed in the past 30 years as South Sudan struggled against Sudan for independence and then factions in South Sudan turned on one another. In the beginning, Mr. Kiir and Mr. Machar fought together in the war for independence, but later Mr. Machar broke off and joined the   Sudanese government against Mr. Kiir and his rebels, who are not Arab. Mr. Machar eventually returned to the rebel fold and was a crucial figure in the South Sudanese government when it achieved independence five years ago. Many analysts said the mistrust between Mr. Kiir and Mr. Machar might run too deep to overcome. Western and African nations have exerted enormous pressure on the two to work together, even with the threat of sanctions and international isolation. The fighting began on Thursday over something relatively small. A group of soldiers loyal to Mr. Kiir stopped a vehicle carrying a group of soldiers loyal to Mr. Machar, a senior United Nations official said. An argument erupted over whether the vehicle could pass through a checkpoint, and guns were drawn. Shooting started, leading to rolling battles across Juba that continued through Monday. By Monday evening, the shooting had subsided, but aid officials said the two sides were using the lull to reposition their forces.",Foregin,

Former President Bill Clinton can be heard telling his former mistress, Gennifer Flowers, to deny that he helped her get a state job in a series of recorded phone conversation from 1991. 
‚ÄúIf they ever asked if you‚Äôd talked to me about it, you can say no,‚Äù Clinton is heard saying in the recording. 
At the time, the media was making inquiries about Flowers‚Äô alleged affair with Clinton, and she was concerned that they may question how she got a job as administrative assistant for the Arkansas Appeal Tribunal. 
Clinton can also be heard telling Flowers how to handle a grievance filed by soemone else who applied for the same positioned and claimed she was more qualified than Flowers. 
Flowers famously recorded a series of conversation she had with Clinton from December 1990 to December 1991, while he was still Governor of Arkansas. The audio segments about the state job were widely reported in the 1990‚Äôs, however, as other pay-for-play financial scandals have surfaced, the details may warrant revisiting. 

Here is a transcript of part of the recording: 
GF ‚Äì But anyway, then Wednesday, there was a grievance filed in my office when I got the job by a girl who felt like she should have gotten it, a black girl named (deleted). And they called me as a witness. So I go in and uh, nothing big came of it. It‚Äôs just that they were questioning me about how I found out about the job. And I said, ‚ÄúWell, that personnel said it that it was a possibility there would be a position,‚Äù and then uh, ‚Äúthey told me that it would be advertised in the newspaper. And it was and I pursued it from there. 
BC ‚Äì Good for you. 
GF: Yeah. We had a little bit of a scare recently because she had a spot on an X-ray. And she went and had it checked again and it wasn‚Äôt cancer. And it‚Äôs been almost, it‚Äôll be two years in May that she‚Äôs now diagnosed cancer free. My stepfather has been through two angioplasties, but he‚Äôs doing good. And I am, I‚Äôm really, Bill what I‚Äôm afraid of is that if somebody in the press finds out that I‚Äôm working for the state. 
BC ‚Äì Yeah. 
GF ‚Äì They‚Äôre going to make a big deal of it. 
BC ‚Äì Yeah. 
GF ‚Äì Well the only thing that concerns me, where I‚Äôm, where I‚Äôm concerned at this point is the state job. 
BC ‚Äì Yeah. I never thought about that, but as long as you say you‚Äôve just been looking for one, you‚Äôd uh, check on it. If they ever asked if you‚Äôd talked to me about it, you can say no.",Foregin,
"Alabama Declares State Of Emergency Over Pipeline Explosion   ‚Äî Gov. Robert Bentley (@GovernorBentley) November 1, 2016 
Governor Robert Bentley has declared a month-long state of emergency for Alabama after a pipeline explosion in Shelby County on Monday. 
The explosion killed one worker and injured six others.The blast shut down the pipeline, that supplies gasoline to millions of people, for the second time in less than two months , raising concerns over possible gas shortages and price hikes. 
The state of emergency came into effect on Tuesday and will last until December 1st unless the governor sees fit to end it sooner. 
RT reports: 
On Monday, construction crews working on the Colonial Pipeline in the area just south of Birmingham accidentally hit a transmission pipe, causing an explosion in which seven workers were injured, one of them fatally. The explosion also started a fire. The contractors were attempting to repair the pipeline segment that was damaged in September, spilling gas into the countryside. 
An extended shutdown could cause fuel shortages and higher gas prices in Alabama, Georgia, North and South Carolina, and Tennessee, similar to what happened after the September accident. 
‚ÄúAn accident of this magnitude is tough for any community to deal with, and I want to personally thank the local first responders for their immediate assistance to this accident, as well as the first responders from surrounding counties. They all provided resources and support to the help Shelby County in their time of need,‚Äù Bentley said, announcing the emergency declaration. 
The state of emergency will enable Alabama to obtain a waiver from the federal government for transporting gasoline through the state, and avert fuel shortages caused by the pipeline disruption. 
Aerial surveillance of the explosion site shows that the fire continues to burn. The gasoline line will remain out of service at least for the rest of the week, Colonial Pipeline said. The secondary pipeline ‚Äì which transports diesel, jet fuel and other petroleum products, was returned to service Tuesday morning. Share This Article...",Foregin,

"The 3. 4 million U. S. citizens on the Caribbean island of Puerto Ricans will vote today, for the fifth time, on a   referendum to become independent or to apply to be America‚Äôs 51st state, despite already declaring bankruptcy last month. [Puerto Rico has a poverty rate of 45 percent, 12. 4 percent unemployment, and 86 percent of residents do not speak English in the home, but the island receives $22 billion in federal subsidies. The top income tax rate is 4 percent and residents are exempt from paying $2 billion in federal income taxes. That explains why 61 percent of residents voted for statehood in 2012, but nothing happened.  As Breitbart News reported several weeks ago, Puerto Rico filed the largest municipal bankruptcy in the history of the United States on May 3. The island and its   utility ran out of cash and defaulted on its $73 billion of debt. After the filing, Breitbart reported that Puerto Rico‚Äôs public pension plans only have $1. 8 billion in assets to pay $45 billion in liabilities. Christopher Columbus first arrived at Puerto Rico in 1493 and named the island San Juan Bautista. But after gold was discovered in a river, it was given the Spanish name for ‚Äúrich port. ‚Äù The conquistadors Spanish combined the labor of indigenous Ta√≠no and Carib Indian people with African slaves to operate large sugar cane, coffee and tobacco farms. After the   War, Puerto Rico joined Cuba, the Philippines and Guam as war booty paid to the U. S. under the Treaty of Paris of 1898. Puerto Ricans received U. S. citizenship in 1917 and officially became a U. S. Commonwealth in 1952. The island is often referred to as the ‚ÄúOldest Colony in the World. ‚Äù A U. S. District Court in New York City has jurisdiction over the congressionally mandated oversight board for Puerto Rico‚Äôs Title III bankruptcy. According to initial bankruptcy filings, the per capita debt for each man, woman and child in Puerto Rico is about $34, 000. The island‚Äôs median household income was $18, 626 in 2015, versus $56, 500 for the U. S. mainland. Much of the debt is now held by ‚Äúvulture capitalist‚Äù hedge funds that bought bonds for as little as 25 percent of face value. The investors claim that Puerto Rico can regain its solvency by raising taxes and firing tens of thousands of public sector workers. Bloomberg reported just as the Puerto Rico crisis began, investors and the island have fighting ‚Äúover who owns cash collected by the government‚Äôs sales tax agency, known by its Spanish acronym Cofina. ‚Äù The island claims that despite not making any bond payments, the island will miss payroll on November 1 if the sales tax is paid out to bondholders. Breitbart News has suggested that  Puerto Rico‚Äôs bankruptcy filing represents a massive liability risk for independent auditors, who will likely demand that   states  ‚Äî   such as Connecticut, Illinois and California  ‚Äî   disclose more liabilities, write down assets, and curtail debt issues. Greater accounting scrutiny of municipal and state finances will lead to credit rating downgrades and requirements for higher pension payments. That may explain why California Governor Jerry Brown warned in his   May Budget Revision update that California is expected to suffer a $20 billion tax crash in the next recession.  ",Foregin,
"Here is a guide to understanding Britain‚Äô‚Äôs vote to leave the European Union, a decision known as ‚ÄúBrexit‚Äù that will have global consequences for years to come. Complete news coverage is here. More than 17. 4 million Britons voted June 23 to sever ties with the European Union, whose seat of power lies in Brussels, compared with 16. 1 million who voted to remain. The stunning vote, 52 percent to 48 percent, plunged world financial markets into turmoil, the political consequences for the prime minister of Britain were swift, and people around the globe reacted with shock and confusion. It would be the first time any country has left the bloc. Fear of being overrun by immigrants was a driving concern for ‚ÄúLeave‚Äù voters, who appeared to dominate the conversation on social media. Globalization concerns and a desire to wrest Britain from under Brussels‚Äô thumb were also factors. The referendum came about as a result of a promise made in 2013 by Prime Minister David Cameron to appease an increasingly vocal   Union wing of his Conservative Party. ‚ñ† The prime minister said he would step down. Mr. Cameron, who led the ‚ÄúRemain‚Äù campaign, announced on Friday that he had no ‚Äùprecise timetable‚Äù but that he believed his successor  ‚Äî   who will manage the process of leaving the union  ‚Äî   should be in place by October. Boris Johnson, the former mayor of London who backed leaving the E. U. was considered a   to succeed Mr. Cameron. But on June 30, Mr. Johnson announced he would not run for the position of party leader (and therefore prime minister). ‚ñ† Global markets plunged. The British pound plummeted to its lowest level since 1985. Investors fled to the American dollar and the yen.  ‚ñ† The U. S. market was down more than 3 percent at the close on June 24, with the Dow shedding over 600 points, after   overnight in Japan and Hong Kong. The financial damage was more severe on the Continent than in Britain and the United States.  ‚ñ† The United Kingdom lost its last remaining AAA credit rating on June 27, when the credit rating agency Standard  Poor‚Äôs downgraded the nation to AA, Reuters reported. ‚ñ† The referendum is not legally binding, though it is difficult to imagine that the British government would ignore the will of the voters. The process of leaving begins only after the British government invokes a provision of the European Union‚Äôs governing treaty known as Article 50  ‚Äî   an action Mr. Cameron said he would leave to his successor. Once Article 50 is invoked, though, Britain could not change its mind and stay in the union unless the 27 other members all agreed. ‚ñ† Britain would leave the world‚Äôs largest common market, with 508 million residents, including 65 million Britons. That would free them from the bloc‚Äôs commitment to the free movement of labor, capital, goods and services. But it would also bring complications, with some businesses already planning to relocate. ‚ñ† Little will change for at least two years, but the vote sets off a series of negotiations as the country separates from the union‚Äôs remaining 27 members. Britain, which has the bloc‚Äôs   economy after Germany, would have to come up with new trading agreements. Almost half its exports are sold on Europe‚Äôs common market. ‚ñ† London‚Äôs role as a financial center could be imperiled, particularly if the trade in   securities moves to rival cities like Paris and Frankfurt. ‚ñ† The immediate effect on travel will be limited, especially as Britain was not a member of the   Schengen zone, which came under heavy pressure last year from the refugee crisis. Americans will find bargains in travel to Britain, because of more favorable exchange rates. ‚ñ†  Britain‚Äôs security will be largely unaffected: It remains a nuclear power, a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council and a leader of NATO. ‚ñ† Scotland and Northern Ireland could go their own way. Both voted overwhelmingly to stay in the E. U. But prominent political leaders in Scotland and Northern Ireland called on Friday for new moves toward separating from Britain. Scotland, which voted in 2014 to remain in the United Kingdom, may revisit that referendum. Northern Ireland has an open border with the Republic of Ireland, a member of the bloc. Border crossings could now be tightened, and pressure could increase for unification, prompting instability in both places. ‚ñ† Calls for similar action have spread throughout Europe. ‚ÄúWe must now have the same referendum,‚Äù French   National Front party leader Marine Le Pen tweeted. Politicians made similar appeals in Denmark and the Netherlands. In Italy, one politician called for a referendum on whether to keep the euro currency. ‚ñ† President Obama said in a statement: ‚ÄúThe people of the United Kingdom have spoken, and we respect their decision. ‚Äù He pledged that the U. K. and the E. U. would remain ‚Äúindispensable partners of the United States‚Äù and that Britain‚Äôs ‚Äúspecial relationship‚Äù with the United States would endure. ‚ñ† Hillary Clinton: ‚ÄúWe respect the choice the people of the United Kingdom have made. Our first task has to be to make sure that the economic uncertainty created by these events does not hurt working families here in America. ‚Äù ‚ñ† Donald J. Trump: ‚ÄúI said this was going to happen, and I think that it‚Äôs a great thing. ‚Äù The British people ‚Äúhave declared their independence from the European Union, and have voted to reassert control over their own politics, borders and economy,‚Äù Mr. Trump said. ‚ÄúA Trump administration pledges to strengthen our ties with a free and independent Britain. ‚Äù ‚ñ† Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany expressed disappointment with the vote and called for European unity. ‚ÄúOur goal should be to create a future relationship between Great Britain and the European Union that is close and  . ‚Äù ‚ñ† Moscow maintained its stance that the British referendum was of little direct concern. President Vladimir V. Putin said, ‚ÄúThis will certainly have consequences for Britain, for Europe and for us. The consequences will be global, they are inevitable they will be both positive and negative. ‚Äù",Foregin,
"Seattle Mayor Ed Murray, famed as a staunch gay rights advocate and a champion of progressive causes, has been accused of sexually molesting several teenaged boys 30 years ago, reports have revealed. [A trio of men came forward to allege that Murray had sex with them decades ago when they were underage. At least one said he was 15 when the mayor molested him back in the 1980s, according to the Seattle Times.  A man identified only as ‚ÄúD. H. ‚Äù now 46, filed a lawsuit against the    Murray alleging that the famed mayor and activist began molesting him when he was only 15 and exacerbated problems he had during his life starting when he was a teen. He also claims that Murray was fully aware of his underage status. D. H. claims that he has been ‚Äúdealing with this for over 30 years,‚Äù and filed the lawsuit as part of the ‚Äúhealing process. ‚Äù The accuser said he hoped the lawsuit would help him to repair his mental issues after years of ‚Äúthe shame, the embarrassment, the guilt, the humiliation that I put myself through and that he put me through. ‚Äù The plaintiff also alleged that he took money from Murray for the sexual encounters up to 50 times over a four or five year period. After the lawsuit had been made public, Murray issued a press release calling the accusations false: These false accusations are intended to damage a prominent elected official who has been a defender of vulnerable populations for decades. It is not a coincidence that this shakedown effort comes within weeks of the campaign filing deadline. These unsubstantiated assertions, dating back three decades, are categorically false. Mayor Murray has never engaged in an inappropriate relationship with any minor.   ‚Ä¶     Mayor Murray will vigorously fight these allegations in court. Murray also pledged to continue his bid for   as the city‚Äôs Mayor. The Seattle mayor has been the subject of such allegations in the past, with one case going as far back as 1984. Jeff Simpson came forward decades ago alleging that he met Murray in a Portland center for troubled children and was later molested for an extended period by the man who would become mayor. A police investigation was launched in the 80s, but no charges were ever filed. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt necessarily think that he destroyed my life,‚Äù Simpson said about his experience, ‚ÄúBut I believe a lot of the problems I have stemmed from this. ‚Äù Simpson‚Äôs story was buttressed by Lloyd Anderson, another man who claims to have been molested by Murray back in the 1980s. ‚ÄúLook, the guy took advantage of my situation,‚Äù Anderson said of his experience in the 1980s. ‚ÄúI was young, I was homeless and doing drugs and everything. ‚Äù Mayor Murray characterized some of the allegations as a ‚Äú ‚Äù attack on his career. ‚ÄúThe two older accusations were promoted by extreme     activists in the midst of the marriage equality campaign, and were thoroughly investigated and dismissed by both law enforcement authorities and the media,‚Äù he said in a statement. Murray insists that these lawsuits and allegations are politically motivated. The mayor has a long history of fighting for progressive causes. When he was in the state legislature, for instance, he led the fight for the state to recognize gay marriage. And once elected Seattle‚Äôs mayor, Murray launched a campaign to push the city‚Äôs minimum wage to $15 an hour. Murray has also been a leading opponent of President Donald Trump favoring efforts to torpedo the president‚Äôs immigration policies.

"Watching male and female models stride down the runways in tandem as more designers combined their women‚Äôs and men‚Äôs collections this New York Fashion Week raised the questions of what is masculine and what is feminine, how much those distinctions matter, and who gets to decide. Depending on which show you viewed, it‚Äôs fine for men to sport blue feather boas or fishnet shirts with a bow (Jeremy Scott). Or for women and men to wear virtually interchangeable clothes, in restrained, minimalist androgyny (Raf Simons for Calvin Klein). Or for women to feminize the puffer by wearing it off the shoulder, cinched at the waist (Public School). Society is in a time of renewed ferment about gender. Culture wars rage over bathrooms and even the very notion that men or women have to choose one fixed gender identity. President Donald J. Trump reportedly likes his female staff ‚Äúto dress like women‚Äù just what this means isn‚Äôt entirely clear. The divide looms between those who welcome the new fluidity and those who yearn for clearly defined gender roles. So designers on the runway this week engaged in a continuing dialogue about how clothing defines masculinity and femininity  ‚Äî   and how it scrambles these notions, too. Fashion has crossed many of these lines for years, of course. Women have long appropriated men‚Äôs clothes for comfort and authority. In the 1960s, longhaired men in paisley, florals and   defied conventions of what men were supposed to look like and what clothes they were supposed to wear. Jean Paul Gaultier put a man in a skirt back in 1984. And last year, Jaden Smith wore clothes designed for women in a Louis Vuitton advertisement. But showing the women‚Äôs and men‚Äôs lines together allowed for   consideration of what the differences were, really. Material? Designers used the same fabrics for many of the men‚Äôs and women‚Äôs collections. Cut? In some cases, the tailoring seemed uncannily similar. Accessories? Many designers included accessories that once would have been thought exclusively feminine or masculine on both male and female models. Fashion, like society, is clearly not opting for hard and fast rules. Yet each designer brought a particular sensibility to the gender continuum. Raf Simons made his name in men‚Äôs wear before expanding to women‚Äôs clothing. His first collection for Calvin Klein was also the first time the house showed both men‚Äôs and women‚Äôs lines in the same show. Mr. Simons was known for a distinctive male model, skinny and less bulked up, and he has said he designed some of his distinctive   suits for that physique. In this show, much of the men‚Äôs and women‚Äôs clothing looked all but identical there were a few times when it was hard to figure out whether the model was a man or a woman. There were glen plaid suits with   blazers and black leather jackets with silver rose cutouts for men and women. The   pants and varsity stripe motifs were echoed in the men‚Äôs and women‚Äôs clothes. Mr. Simons played with the idea of transparency: women in sheer tops showing nipples men in sheer tops showing theirs. But he did not overtly cross gender lines by putting men in skirts. And he showed some simply beautiful feminine clothes, such as the dresses made of feathers encased in sheer plastic. For Public School, the designers   Chow and Maxwell Osborne took street motifs often associated with men  ‚Äî   parkas, puffers, hoodies, anoraks  ‚Äî   and toyed with how to dress women in them. The    puffers for women were a surprisingly sensual look for a normally unisex coat the men in the show wore the puffers short, not big or baggy. As with the other runway shows, combining men and women allowed the designers to present one aesthetic and show how it applied to each gender. At Public School, a man walked out in a plaid shirt and slightly baggy pants with a zipper, followed by a woman wearing the same plaid shirt as a dress with a navy train. A man wore an oversize glen paid top a woman wore the same glen plaid ensemble but belted and draped more closely to her body. Generally, the men‚Äôs and women‚Äôs looks were not interchangeable rather, men were in recognizable men‚Äôs clothes, and women were more often in dresses and skirts, with bare shoulders and material gathered in artful folds. It was a brasher vision than Calvin Klein‚Äôs, further along the continuum of sexual distinction. Jeremy Scott had it both ways: gender traditional in his unabashed sexuality for women and nonconforming in his use of what were once thought of as feminine colors, styles and accessories for men. Many of his designs for women were sex kittenish, including baby doll dresses, fishnet stockings,   boots, short shorts in pink knit, and clingy tops in silver lam√©. Men wore styles and colors that used to be associated with femininity: clingy velour pants in fuchsia and purple or jackets with gold fringe and purple sleeves. And sometimes Mr. Scott drew inspiration from both tropes in one look: He sent out a male model in a plaid skirt worn like a tunic over ripped jeans, finished off with an oversize parka. Men and women wore his signature Jesus motif coats with leopard accents  ‚Äî   the women‚Äôs coats tighter, the men‚Äôs looser. In the end, designers ran the gamut, from blurring the lines between men and women to embracing them, sometimes in the same collection. It may be that fashion‚Äôs refusal to decide, to render any one verdict, is as radical as some of the more overtly political statements made this week on the runways.",Foregin,

"  // 0 Comments Clinton campaign in crisis after FBI agents uncover Hillary emails among sexts to underage girls on Anthony Weiner‚Äôs phone. 
The new Hillary Clinton emails uncovered by the FBI were discovered on electronic devices belonging to Huma Abedin and her husband, Anthony Weiner . 
The devices were seized by the FBI as they investigate allegations Weiner sent illicit sexual messages to underage girls. 
The New York Times reports that ‚Äú The F.B.I. is investigating illicit text messages that Mr. Weiner sent to a 15-year-old girl in North Carolina. The bureau told Congress on Friday that it had uncovered new emails related to the Clinton case ‚Äî one federal official said they numbered in the thousands ‚Äî potentially reigniting an issue that has weighed on the presidential campaign and offering a lifeline to Donald J. Trump less than two weeks before the election. ‚Äú 
Huma Abedin, Hillary‚Äôs closest aide, separated from her husband Weiner recently after it was revealed he conducted an online affair with an underage girl ‚Äì the latest in a long line of scandals for the former congressman. 
The FBI informed Congress that while analyzing Weiner‚Äôs phone agents had uncovered new Hillary Clinton emails related to the investigation into whether Clinton and her aides mishandled classified information. 
The announcement has breathed new life into the Trump campaign ‚Äì and proved the Republican nominee was eerily accurate with an old prediction. In a statement on his website immediately after the Abedin-Weiner split, Trump questioned Hillary‚Äôs judgement in allowing someone like Weiner into her circle of trust: 
DONALD J. TRUMP STATEMENT ON HILLARY CLINTON‚ÄôS BAD JUDGMENT ‚Äú Huma is making a very wise decision. I know Anthony Weiner well, and she will be far better off without him. I only worry for the country in that Hillary Clinton was careless and negligent in allowing Weiner to have such close proximity to highly classified information. Who knows what he learned and who he told? It‚Äôs just another example of Hillary Clinton‚Äôs bad judgment. It is possible that our country and its security have been greatly compromised by this.‚Äù ‚Äì Donald J. Trump 
And previously, in an Aug. 3 tweet: It came out that Huma Abedin knows all about Hillary‚Äôs private illegal emails. Huma‚Äôs PR husband, Anthony Weiner, will tell the world.",Foregin,
"A    man was attacked by a bear in the wilderness of southwest Montana. Alone and injured, he walked  ‚Äî   then drove  ‚Äî   for miles to save himself. How did he do it? The man, Todd Orr, said he was scouting for elk in a mountainous valley on Sept. 30 when he was attacked twice by a female grizzly. Bleeding, stunned and suffering a cracked bone and deep gashes, Mr. Orr said he hiked through the woods for miles to reach his truck. In a gory video that had been viewed more than 37 million times by Thursday, Facebook posts  describing the maulings and a new website that allows the public to track his recovery, Mr. Orr, 50, offers insights into the psychology of survival. While few people will encounter an angry bear in their lives, those in the business of first aid and extreme survival said his social media imprints invited general reflection: When someone finds themselves isolated, injured and bleeding, what should he or she do to survive the lonely trek in search of medical help? Dr. R. D. Marks, whose medical staff was the first to treat Mr. Orr, said the injured man came out of the woods on the morning after the attack and went to the Madison Valley Medical Center in the small city of Ennis, Mont. for help. ‚ÄúHe just showed up at the door,‚Äù Dr. Marks said on Thursday. ‚ÄúI think he called ahead and said he was coming. By that time it was like his badge: ‚ÄòI got bit by a grizzly bear and I got a story to tell.‚Äô ‚Äù Mr. Orr, who builds custom knives for a living, was recovering from multiple surgeries and unable to return telephone messages, according to a statement on his website. But in Facebook posts published last weekend, he said he had been scouting elk in Madison Valley, in the Lee Metcalf Wilderness area. That is bear country, Mr. Orr wrote. He should know he was raised in the area. Armed with a pistol and repellent spray, he made lots of noise so as not to surprise any bears, which can make them lash out. ‚ÄúI hollered out, ‚ÄòHey, bear‚Äô about every 30 seconds,‚Äù he wrote. But suddenly, on the trail ahead, he spotted a grizzly with cubs. She charged. A dose of repellent did nothing to slow her down. He hit the ground, face down, and she was on top of him, biting his arms, shoulders and backpack. ‚ÄúThe force of each bite was like a sledgehammer with teeth,‚Äù he wrote. ‚ÄúShe would stop for a few seconds and then bite again. Over and over. ‚Äù Then the bear ambled away. Stunned and bleeding, Mr. Orr started back down the trail toward his truck, about a   trek. He took stock of his injuries: mostly puncture wounds on his arms and shoulder. He did not want to pause to dress the wounds, he wrote, so he     toward what he thought was safety. But then, a sound: It was the same bear, charging toward him again. He hit the dirt, covering his neck with his arms and pressing his face to the ground to protect his eyes: the textbook position to take during a bear attack. One bite clamped onto his forearm, and he heard a crunch. He gasped from the pain, but the sound sent the animal into a frenzy, biting his shoulder and upper back even more. So, Mr. Orr said, he played dead, lying motionless and silent as the bear bit his head, even as blood gushed into his eyes and face. ‚ÄúI thought this was the end,‚Äù he wrote. Finally, the animal stopped. She stood on his back. Without moving, he endured moments of terrifying intimacy as the animal sniffed him. He felt her breath on his neck, her claws digging into his back, smelled her ‚Äúpungent odor. ‚Äù Then she was gone. Somehow, Mr. Orr got to his feet. His pistol had been knocked out of reach. ‚ÄúBut a quick assessment told me I could make it another 45 minutes to the truck without losing too much blood,‚Äù he wrote. He took off along the trail. At the end of the path, he took photographs and the video. Panting,   and with streams of blood crisscrossing his face, Mr. Orr recorded his injuries as he spoke to the camera. ‚ÄúShe got my head good,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know what is under my hat. My ear, my arm, pieces of stuff hanging out  ‚Äî   I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs going on in there,‚Äù he said, displaying his mangled arm. ‚ÄúAnd then my shoulder she ripped up I think my arm‚Äôs broke. But legs are good. Internal organs are good. Eyes are good,‚Äù he said. He got into the truck and drove, calling his girlfriend and 911, and asking a rancher along the way to telephone ahead for help. When Mr. Orr arrived at the medical center, Dr. Marks said, it was about 8 in the morning. Mr. Orr had driven six miles to reach a highway, and another 10 to get to the medical center, Dr. Marks estimated. ‚ÄúPeople are kind of amazing,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWe think about how terrible these things are, and some people do freak out, but most people go into survival mode, and you get crystal clear: ‚ÄòHere is what I gotta do,‚Äô and they do it. ‚ÄúYou take inventory and find everything is working  ‚Äî   I am alive,‚Äù he added. Mr. Orr said he had a   gash above his ear and multiple bite marks for which he underwent several surgeries. Dr. Marks said Mr. Orr most likely stanched some of the heavy bleeding from his scalp wound by having his baseball cap pulled down over his head while on the trail. ‚ÄúIt kind of pulled the edges together and controlled the bleeding, for the most part,‚Äù Dr. Marks said. ‚ÄúKind of like putting a pressure dressing on. I don‚Äôt know if he thought about it that way. ‚Äù Tod Schimelpfenig, the curriculum director at NOLS Wilderness Medicine, a Wyoming school for wilderness medicine education, said that Mr. Orr was lucky the bear did not bite into an artery, penetrate his chest or skull, or rip off a large hunk of flesh. That would have made the bleeding unmanageable alone (though had he had help, he could have contained it with an expertly placed tourniquet). For people who might find themselves in similar situations, Mr. Schimelpfenig said puncture wounds should be treated by applying direct pressure for up to five minutes. With multiple punctures, you must ‚Äúfigure out the worst one. ‚Äù   showed that Mr. Orr had a cracked forearm bone, but on the trail he was apparently unhindered by it. A stabilizing splint could be fashioned with a shirt tail and a safety pin, Mr. Schimelpfenig said. Replenishing fluids is key, because you could lose blood while exerting yourself  ‚Äî   as Mr. Orr was while walking while injured. Mr. Orr‚Äôs presence of mind was notable. In the video, he demonstrated behavior common to extreme survivors. He was objective, giving a factual accounting of the parts of his body that still worked. He was accepting  ‚Äî   admitting what he did not know, like the extent of his other wounds. In the Facebook post, Mr. Orr recalled that at one point he felt gratitude on the trail, saying he ‚Äúthanked God for getting me through‚Äù the first attack. He grieved when the second attack occurred, then said he felt ‚Äúdouble lucky‚Äù when he survived it. During the lonely trek out of the woods, in the dark, he continued to plan. He emphasized a connection with his fellow human beings, saying that after the attack, he had been concerned that other people might run into the bear. He imparted advice. ‚ÄúBe safe out there,‚Äù he said, his eyes darting around while he was still out in the open. ‚ÄúBear spray doesn‚Äôt always work. But it‚Äôs better than nothing. ‚Äù Most important for survival, Mr. Orr described focusing on living, Mr. Schimelpfenig observed. ‚ÄúHe came up with a plan, he saw the future, he was happy with what he had: ‚ÄòThis is my reality here is what I am going to do,‚Äô ‚Äù he said. ‚ÄùHe did not lie there and hope someone was going to find him. ‚Äù",Foregin,
"Here are the top 10 comments of the week on our digital platforms, as selected by our readers and the journalists who moderate nearly every comment. 1. Simone Biles, Aly Raisman and the rest of the USA gymnastics team represent what is best about America: a place where talent, hard work, diversity, and mutual respect lead to the kind of achievement that all of can proudly share with each other.  ‚Äî   Dylan111 in New Haven, reacting to an article about the gymnast Simone Biles winning the gold medal in the women‚Äôs   competition Thursday. Her teammate Aly Raisman won the silver. Tuesday night, the United States team of five won gold in the team competition. This comment had more than 50 reader recommendations. 2. The anthem is a series of questions: Can you see? Does that banner yet wave? The U. S. national anthem is ideally suited to feature ‚Äúunstable, questioning chords. ‚Äù And to my ears, the use of the relative minor chords doesn‚Äôt necessarily sound ‚Äúsad‚Äù I think it‚Äôs also accurate to say those moments sound ‚Äúnoble‚Äù or ‚Äústately‚Äù or ‚Äústoic. ‚Äù I suspect that people are reacting to the instrumentation as much as the harmonization  ‚Äî   this version has some reflective strings instead of      bass drums and brass. There‚Äôs nothing wrong with this arrangement, unless you insist that the national anthem be as bombastic and aggressive as possible, every time you hear it.  ‚Äî   Brian T. in Lexington, Ky. reacting to an article about the version of the national anthem that is played when a United States athlete wins a gold medal at the Rio Olympics, which some listeners say sounds ‚Äúsad‚Äù because of the preponderance of minor chords in the arrangement. This comment received more than 110 reader recommendations. 3. [Michael] Phelps was impressive tonight but Simone‚Äôs historic victory is so much more meaningful and will go a long way in inspiring the next generation, especially those who are   in swimming.  ‚Äî   Nancy Rhee on The Times‚Äôs Facebook page, responding to an article about Simone Manuel, who tied for the gold medal in the women‚Äôs   freestyle, becoming the first   woman to win an individual swimming medal in the Olympics. This comment received more than 35 likes.  4. I‚Äôm glad Lilly won, but this is one rude woman. I heard her on NPR this morning, and she‚Äôs got the empathy of a birdbath. Is she not aware the doping was state sponsored? Does she have any idea what it would be like to go against Putin  his lackeys? Did her opponent not suffer enough during her ban and during the introduction to the race? We‚Äôre all against doping, but forgiveness and moving on  ‚Äî   with adequate testing  ‚Äî   are much nobler traits than what I saw last night.  ‚Äî   ECF1 in New York, reacting to an article about the open criticism of athletes who have served doping suspensions by their opponents at the Rio Games. Lilly King, the American who won the women‚Äôs   breaststroke Monday, wagged a finger at Yulia Efimova of Russia, who served a suspension for a banned substance and contested another before competing at these Olympics.  5. It‚Äôs a huge historic day for our little island nation of Fiji. We are so very proud of our players and the coaching staff. Our Fiji rugby team made us so happy today. We will never forget. Vinaka Boys. ..Go Fiji Go!  ‚Äî   Altaf Ali on The Times‚Äôs Facebook page, responding to an article about Fiji‚Äôs   gold medal Thursday, in rugby sevens. Fiji defeated Britain,  .  6. What‚Äôs so weird? A fair number of women marry their coaches. They spend all their time training and no life outside of it. Doctors marry nurses and other doctors. Lawyers marry other lawyers. We say nothing. Now, we have an opinion? Who are we to judge?  ‚Äî   Shelley Pasternak on The Times‚Äôs Facebook page, responding to an article about the Hungarian swimmer Katinka Hosszu, whose relationship with her   has raised eyebrows in and out of the pool at the Olympics. Ms. Hosszu has won three gold medals so far at the Rio Games. This comment received more than 120 likes. 7. I‚Äôm sorry, but I just can‚Äôt take out the violins. However, I do hope, with all my heart that she remembers those ‚Äúlean‚Äù years if she‚Äôs elected when she makes decisions that affect the 90 percent of Americans who are struggling. I have my doubts. Contrary to this story, my rent in NYC in 1980 was $285 a month, and I still went to sleep at night worrying how I would make it. I was waitressing and putting myself through college. Much of how I see the world and the struggles of the people around me in Myanmar and in the U. S. go back to that time. We can only hope Hillary remembers something somewhat comparable. Unfortunately, ‚ÄúLet them eat cake‚Äù too often comes to mind. I still miss that guy from Brooklyn, the child of immigrant parents, who truly started out with nothing and never forgot it.  ‚Äî   Far From Home in Yangon, Myanmar, reacting to an article about Hillary Clinton‚Äôs competing desires both to serve the public in government and to make money.  8. I think, as I have thought for many years, that Hillary is an incredible woman and leader. But seeing this slice of her personality . .. serves as a nice counterbalance to the prevailing political narrative that she is cold and calculating. I understand that 30 years in public life takes a toll, but years from now I think we‚Äôll look back and there will be a clear delineation between the expectations for men versus women in public life  ‚Äî   and the very, very different paths that she and her husband took to get into office as well as what they did once they were there.  ‚Äî   Laura C. in Philadelphia. 9. Were it not for his religious fanaticism, I would vote for Pence in a heartbeat. In January I will become a full Canadian citizen with the full intention of renouncing the U. S. one that, quite frankly, embarrasses me. I‚Äôm 71 and have lived in Nova Scotia since 2010. While this would be my last chance to vote in a U. S. election, I choose to pass.  ‚Äî   Robert Coane, reacting to an opinion article by Matt Latimer, a former speechwriter for George W. Bush. The article asks the Republican   nominee, Gov. Mike Pence, to persuade Donald J. Trump to withdraw from the presidential race. 10. Trump wants to cut taxes to spark an economic recovery, and specifically drop the corporate tax rate to 15% which would make us   with ALL industrialized nations and likely would put an end to corporate inversions. Leave the country isolated from the world? In point of fact, no  ‚Äî   our corporate taxes are among the very highest in the industrialized world, make us uncompetitive and incentivize our companies to bolt our regulation is stifling expansion and   and free trade policies have played their role, along with offshoring and automation, in   our middle classes. And the rest of ‚Äúthe world‚Äù is hardly healthy  ‚Äî   their tax and regulatory frameworks have a great deal to do with their sorry state. But I can understand the concern: whenever Trump talks sense rather than erupting over some sleight, his numbers go up.  ‚Äî   Richard Luettgen in New Jersey, reacting to an editorial about Mr. Trump‚Äôs economic plan.

"Pecans, with their rich, buttery, sweet flavor, are considered by many to be the quintessential American nut. They once grew wild throughout what is now the American South and Mexico. Native peoples foraged for these highly nutritious nuts, and Spanish explorers took pecans  ‚Äî   along with other unknown New World foods like potatoes, tomatoes, corn and chiles  ‚Äî   back to Europe for cultivation. Today, orchards in the United States continue to produce most of the world‚Äôs supply. I have had them on the brain ever since I received a giant bag of   pecans from a friend in New Mexico recently. With the holiday season (a. k. a. the baking season) nigh upon us, I began to think of what to do with them. I don‚Äôt have much of a sweet tooth, but I will happily make an exception when homemade pecan rolls or other members of the sticky bun family are in the room. And if they happen to be rolled in cinnamon sugar, so much the better. Pecan rolls are a particularly fond childhood memory for me. Occasionally, a dozen freshly baked ones would arrive at our house, packed in a   shoe box  ‚Äî   the gift of a doting aunt on a baking spree. It was impossible not to eat at least two of them. I would eat them from the top down, unfurling the rolls‚Äô spiral layers and saving the sugary caramelized bottom for last. Many years later, I found work as a professional baker, and making cinnamon rolls became a daily task. I baked dozens and dozens each day, even more on weekends, gaining proficiency, to say the least. (For quality control, I sampled one from each batch.) So playing with this pecan version was like riding a bike. Some home bakers are fearful of yeasted doughs. Don‚Äôt be. The key is to let the yeast do its work and allow the dough to rise sufficiently before popping your creations into the oven. These pecan rolls are baked in muffin tins to help them puff proudly. Just be sure not to rush them: The longer they rise, the lighter they‚Äôll be. Bake them until the tops are nicely browned and well burnished. That is the way to ensure a golden glazed underside. Don‚Äôt we all love the classic   filling of a good pecan pie? For these pecan bars, I wanted a similar sensation, but with a heaping dose of spice. Cardamom, allspice, nutmeg and clove add a kind of peppery warmth to these. I also craved the earthy presence and deep dark hue that a touch of molasses can contribute. Rather than rely on too much sugar or syrup, I folded chopped dates into the batter to increase the sticky factor. A thick layer of buttery shortbread is the base, baked in a square cake pan, with a generous layer of crisp pecans on top. You can cut the flat pie into   bars or into   pieces. The best thing about it is that you can store these bars at room temperature for days on end with no loss of quality. In fact, they seem to improve with a little age. (They also freeze well.) I‚Äôll confess to a weakness for cheese puffs and other cheesy nibbles, and some kind of salty baked good is always welcome with drinks. For these savory cookies, grated Parmesan was my choice. Chopped pecans, fresh sage and a good spoonful of coarsely ground black pepper went into the dough. It is as easy to put together as any type of cookie dough, but not a speck of sugar goes in. The dough can be shaped into a log (keep a couple in the fridge at the ready) for    savory cookies, or it may be rolled out like pie dough and cut into shapes. They‚Äôll keep a week in an airtight tin, if it‚Äôs perched well out of reach serve the cookies with cocktails or add them to a cheese board. Surprise your friends and family with one of these pecan treats, or all three. Give them savory pecan cookies to start,   pecan bars for dessert and a bag of   pecan rolls to take home for breakfast.

" . Barack Obama ( ) plagiarized  . Deval Patrick of Massachusetts on the campaign trail in 2008 when he used Patrick‚Äôs signature line, ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt tell me words don‚Äôt matter. ‚Äù[Jeff Zeleny, then of the New York Times, wrote:  Senator Barack Obama adapted one of his signature arguments  ‚Äî   that his oratory amounts to more than inspiring words  ‚Äî   from speeches given by Gov. Deval Patrick of Massachusetts during his 2006 campaign. At a Democratic Party dinner Saturday in Wisconsin, Mr. Obama, of Illinois, responded to Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton of New York, who has criticized him for delivering smooth speeches but says they do not amount to solutions to the nation‚Äôs problems, by ticking through a string of historic references. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt tell me words don‚Äôt matter,‚Äù Mr. Obama said, to applause. ‚Äú ‚ÄòI have a dream‚Äô  ‚Äî   just words? ‚ÄòWe hold these truths to be   that all men are created equal‚Äô  ‚Äî   just words? ‚ÄòWe have nothing to fear but fear itself‚Äô  ‚Äî   just words? Just speeches?‚Äù Mr. Patrick employed similar language during his 2006 governor‚Äôs race when his Republican rival, Kerry Healey, criticized him as offering lofty rhetoric over specifics. Mr. Patrick has endorsed Mr. Obama, and the two men are close friends.  .

We should be spending time lifting the country up. ‚Äù It was a clear case of plagiarism  ‚Äî   and an ironic one, given that it centered around a phrase promoting the importance of words.

"Dr. James Weinstein, a back pain specialist and chief executive of   Health System, has some advice for most people with lower back pain: Take two aspirin and don‚Äôt call me in the morning. On Monday, the American College of Physicians published updated guidelines that say much the same. In making the new recommendations for the treatment of most people with lower back pain, the group is bucking what many doctors do and changing its previous guidelines, which called for medication as   therapy. Dr. Nitin Damle, president of the group‚Äôs board of regents and a practicing internist, said pills, even    pain relievers and   should not be the first choice. ‚ÄúWe need to look at therapies that are nonpharmacological first,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThat is a change. ‚Äù The recommendations come as the United States is struggling with an epidemic of opioid addiction that often begins with a simple prescription for ailments like back pain. In recent years, a number of states have enacted measures aimed at curbing prescription painkillers. The problem has also led many doctors around the country to reassess prescribing practices. The group did not address surgery. Its focus was on noninvasive treatment. The new guidelines said that doctors should avoid prescribing opioid painkillers for relief of back pain and suggested that before patients try   or muscle relaxants, they should try alternative therapies like exercise, acupuncture, massage therapy or yoga. Doctors should reassure their patients that they will get better no matter what treatment they try, the group said. The guidelines also said that steroid injections were not helpful, and neither was acetaminophen, like Tylenol, although other    pain relievers like aspirin, naproxen or ibuprofen could provide some relief. Dr. Weinstein, who was not an author of the guidelines, said patients have to stay active and wait it out. ‚ÄúBack pain has a natural course that does not require intervention,‚Äù he said. In fact, for most of the people with acute back pain  ‚Äî   defined as present for four weeks or less that does not radiate down the leg  ‚Äî   there is no need to see a doctor at all, said Dr. Rick Deyo, a spine researcher and professor at the Oregon Health and Science University in Portland, Ore. and an author of the new guidelines. ‚ÄúFor acute back pain, the analogy is to the common cold,‚Äù Dr. Deyo said. ‚ÄúIt is very common and very annoying when it happens. But most of the time it will not result in anything major or serious. ‚Äù Even those with chronic back pain  ‚Äî   lasting at least 12 weeks  ‚Äî   should start with nonpharmacological treatments, the guidelines say. If patients still want medication, they can try    drugs like ibuprofen or aspirin. Scans, like an M. R. I. for diagnosis are worse than useless for back pain patients, members of the group said in telephone interviews. The results can be misleading, showing what look like abnormalities that actually are not related to the pain. Measures that help patients get back to their usual routines can help along the way, as Sommer Kleweno Walley, 43, of Seattle, can attest. Last spring, she slipped on the stairs in her house and fell down hard, on her back. ‚ÄúAfter a couple of hours I could barely walk,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúI was in real pain. ‚Äù She saw a physical therapist, but the pain persisted. Eleven days later, she showed up at the office of Dr. Christopher J. Standaert, a spine specialist at the University of Washington and Harborview Medical Center. She expected to receive an M. R. I. at least, and maybe a drug for pain. But Dr. Standaert told her an M. R. I. would not make any difference in her diagnosis or recovery and that the main thing was to keep active. She ended up getting   medication and doing physical therapy. A few months later, her back stopped hurting. It is surprising, some experts in back pain say, how often patients are helped by treatments that are not medical, even by a placebo that patients are told at the start is really a placebo. Dr. Standaert cited a study in which patients with chronic low back pain were offered a placebo, and were told it was a placebo, along with their usual treatment  ‚Äî   often an   drug like ibuprofen or naproxen. Or, the patients remained with their usual treatment alone. Those taking the placebo reported less pain and disability than those in the control group who did not take it. The placebo effect, although modest, was about the same as the effect in studies testing nonpharmacological treatments for back pain like acupuncture, massage or chiropractic manipulations. Many people with chronic back pain tend to shut down, avoiding their usual activities, afraid of making things worse, Dr. Standaert said. Helping them is not a matter of prescribing drugs but rather teaching them to set goals and work toward returning to an active life, even if they still have pain. ‚ÄúThey have to believe their life can get better,‚Äù Dr. Standaert said. ‚ÄúThey have to believe they can get to a better state. ‚Äù The question is: Will the new guidelines be adopted? ‚ÄúPatients are looking for a cure,‚Äù said Dr. Steven J. Atlas, a back pain specialist at Massachusetts General Hospital, who wrote an editorial accompanying the article on the new recommendations. ‚ÄúThe guidelines are for managing pain. ‚Äù Added to the problem are the incentives that push doctors and patients toward medications, scans and injections, Dr. Deyo said. ‚ÄúThere is marketing from professional organizations and from industry,‚Äù he said. ‚Äú‚ÄòWe have the cure. You can expect to be cured. You can expect to be pain free. ‚Äô‚Äù Medical insurance also contributes to the treatment problem, back experts say, because it does not pay for remedies like mindfulness training or chiropractic manipulations which, Dr. Deyo added, ‚Äúare not cheap. ‚Äù Even if doctors want to recommend such treatments, there is no easy referral system, Dr. Atlas said. ‚ÄúIt is much easier at Mass General to get a shot than to get a   or cognitive behavioral therapy,‚Äù he added. Dr. Weinstein has a prescription: ‚ÄúWhat we need to do is to stop medicalizing symptoms,‚Äù he said. Pills are not going to make people better and as for other treatments, he said, ‚Äúyoga and tai chi, all those things are wonderful, but why not just go back to your normal activities?‚Äù ‚ÄúI know your back hurts, but go run, be active, instead of taking a pill. ‚Äù",Foregin,
"PARIS  ‚Äî   It‚Äôs 1944, in occupied Paris. Four friends spend their days in a narrow room atop a Left Bank apartment building. The neighbors think they‚Äôre painters  ‚Äî   a cover story to explain the chemical smell. In fact, the friends are members of a Jewish resistance cell. They‚Äôre operating a clandestine laboratory to make false passports for children and families about to be deported to concentration camps. The youngest member of the group, the lab‚Äôs technical director, is practically a child himself: Adolfo Kaminsky, age 18. If you‚Äôre doubting whether you‚Äôve done enough with your life, don‚Äôt compare yourself to Mr. Kaminsky. By his 19th birthday, he had helped save the lives of thousands of people by making false documents to get them into hiding or out of the country. He went on to forge papers for people in practically every major conflict of the   century. Now 91, Mr. Kaminsky is a small man with a long white beard and tweed jacket, who shuffles around his neighborhood with a cane. He lives in a modest apartment for people with low incomes, not far from his former laboratory. When I followed him around with a film crew one day, neighbors kept asking me who he was. I told them he was a hero of World War II, though his story goes on long after that. It remains painfully relevant today, when children are being bombed in Syria or boarding shabby boats to escape by sea. Like most Westerners, I usually ignore their suffering, and assume that someone else will step in to help. But Mr. Kaminsky  ‚Äî   a poor, hunted teenager  ‚Äî   stepped in himself, during the war and then for many different causes afterward. Why did he do it? It wasn‚Äôt for the glory. He worked in secret and only spoke about it years later. His daughter Sarah learned her father‚Äôs whole story only while writing a book about him, ‚ÄúAdolfo Kaminsky: A Forger‚Äôs Life. ‚Äù The English translation comes out this week. It wasn‚Äôt for the money, either. Mr. Kaminsky says he never accepted payment for forgeries, so that he could keep his motives clear and work only for causes he believed in. He was perpetually broke, and scraped together a living as a commercial photographer, he said. The wartime work put such a strain on his vision that he eventually went blind in one eye. Though he was a skilled forger  ‚Äî   creating passports from scratch and improvising a device to make them look older  ‚Äî   there was little joy in it. ‚ÄúThe smallest error and you send someone to prison or death,‚Äù he told me. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a great responsibility. It‚Äôs heavy. It‚Äôs not at all a pleasure. ‚Äù Years later he‚Äôs still haunted by the work, explaining: ‚ÄúI think mostly of the people that I couldn‚Äôt save. ‚Äù Mr. Kaminsky empathized with refugees partly because he was one himself. He was born in Argentina to Russian Jews who‚Äôd first fled Russia to Paris, and then been kicked out of France. When Adolfo was 7, the family, by then with Argentine passports, was allowed to rejoin relatives in France. ‚ÄúIt was then that I realized the significance of the word ‚Äòpapers,‚Äô ‚Äù he explained. After dropping out of school at 13 to help support his family, he was apprenticed to a clothes dyer, a precursor to the modern dry cleaner. He spent hours figuring out how to remove stains, then read chemistry textbooks and did experiments at home. ‚ÄúMy boss was a chemical engineer, and would answer all of my questions,‚Äù he said. On weekends he helped a chemist at a local dairy, in exchange for butter. In the summer of 1943, he and his family were arrested and sent to Drancy, the internment camp for Jews near Paris that was the last stop before the death camps. This time, their passports saved them. Argentina‚Äôs government protested the family‚Äôs detention, so they stayed at Drancy for three months, while thousands of others were swiftly sent on to die. Mr. Kaminsky remembered a math professor who had agreed to tutor him in the camp. ‚ÄúOne day, when it was time for our classes, he wasn‚Äôt there. He hadn‚Äôt wanted to tell me beforehand that his name was on the list. ‚Äù The Kaminskys were eventually freed, but they weren‚Äôt safe in Paris, where Jews were under constant threat of arrest. Soon Argentines were being deported, too. To survive they would have to go underground. Adolfo‚Äôs father arranged to get false papers from a Jewish resistance group, and sent Adolfo to pick them up. When the agent told Adolfo that they were struggling to erase a certain blue ink from the documents, he advised using lactic acid, a trick he‚Äôd learned at the dairy. It worked, and he was invited to join the resistance. Mr. Kaminsky‚Äôs cell was one of many. His would get tips on who was about to be arrested, then warn the families, assembling new papers for them on the spot. The group focused on the most urgent cases: children who were about to be sent to Drancy. They placed the kids in rural homes or convents, or smuggled them into Switzerland or Spain. In one scene from the book, Mr. Kaminsky stays awake for two nights straight to fill an enormous rush order. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a simple calculation: In one hour I can make 30 blank documents if I sleep for an hour, 30 people will die. ‚Äù Historians estimate that France‚Äôs Jewish resistance networks together saved 7, 000 to 10, 000 children. Some 11, 400 children were deported and killed. After the war, Mr. Kaminsky didn‚Äôt plan to keep working as a forger. But through his wartime networks, other movements got in touch. He continued forging papers for 30 more years, playing a small role in conflicts ranging from the Algerian war of independence to the   struggle in South Africa to the Vietnam War, making documents for American draft dodgers. He estimates that in 1967 alone, he supplied forged papers to people in 15 countries. I can‚Äôt vouch for every cause. Some of the rebel groups he supported used violence. And at close range, his stubborn idealism was no doubt maddening. He had two kids soon after World War II, but couldn‚Äôt tell them or his   about his underground work, so they didn‚Äôt know why he rarely visited. Girlfriends assumed he was absent because he‚Äôd been cheating. He was supposed to follow one woman to America, but never showed up, because he‚Äôd joined the Algerian resistance. ‚ÄúI saved lives because I can‚Äôt deal with unnecessary deaths  ‚Äî   I just can‚Äôt,‚Äù he told me. ‚ÄúAll humans are equal, whatever their origins, their beliefs, their skin color,‚Äù he later added. ‚ÄúThere are no superiors, no inferiors. That is not acceptable for me. ‚Äù In 1971, convinced that too many different groups knew his identity, and that he‚Äôd soon be caught and imprisoned, Mr. Kaminsky quit forging for good, and mostly made a living teaching photography. On a visit to Algiers he met a young law student, of Tuareg ancestry, who was the daughter of a liberal Algerian imam. They‚Äôre still married, and have three children. The last time I saw Mr. Kaminsky, he showed me a photograph he took just after the liberation of Paris. It shows about 30 children who‚Äôd come out of hiding, and were hoping to be reunited with their parents. He knows there are children in similar peril today, and that having the wrong passport can still cost your life. ‚ÄúI did all I could when I could. Now, I can‚Äôt do anything,‚Äù he said. Surely, though, the rest of us can.",Foregin,
"Through nearly five seasons of ‚ÄúVeep,‚Äù we‚Äôve seen Selina Meyer suffer embarrassments galore and absorb loss after loss, to the point that some may wonder how anyone so   and ineffectual ever wound up in the Oval Office. This week‚Äôs episode answers that question: It‚Äôs because Selina can be vicious. ‚ÄúVeep‚Äù can rarely be called triumphant, but toward the end of this episode, when a dazzlingly attired President Meyer is demolishing her enemies with devastating words and a killer smile   ‚Ä¶     well, for a few moments she actually is the most powerful person in the free world. She‚Äôs stunning, in every sense of the word. Selina‚Äôs ballroom blitz is especially satisfying given that ‚ÄúCongressional Ball‚Äù lines it up alongside the spectacular flameout of congressional candidate Jonah Ryan. Most of this episode cuts between the annual White House nondenominational holiday party and a typical New Hampshire campaign stop for Jonah, where his quick temper results in a possible   blunder. Riding high in the polls after essentially making ‚ÄúJonah Ryan: He‚Äôll Yell at Women for You‚Äù into his slogan, the hulking   lashes out at his old bully Teddy Sykes, not realizing that his opponents have angled their camera phones to make it look like he‚Äôs hollering insults at a bowling alley employee with Down syndrome. Without making too big of a deal about it, this episode delivers a cogent point about using rage as a political weapon. In Selina‚Äôs experienced hands, anger is a live grenade. The difference between her and the wannabes is that she knows when and where to throw it. Once again, kudos go to the ‚ÄúVeep‚Äù writers who came up with the idea to have Jonah run for Congress. Nothing in ‚ÄúCongressional Ball‚Äù measures up to last week‚Äôs brilliant campaign ad  ‚Äî   with Jonah chasing a child around a playground in super creepy slow motion  ‚Äî   but even before his alley accident, this episode spins a lot of gold from his   stump speeches, each ending with an instrumental version of ‚ÄúI Won‚Äôt Back Down. ‚Äù (According to Richard Splett, they‚Äôve been getting increasingly angry letters from Tom Petty. But, hey, who hasn‚Äôt?) The highlight of the Jonah half of this episode  ‚Äî   aside from the little Howard Dean scream he gives at the end of the list of New Hampshire towns he hopes to win  ‚Äî   comes early, in his mock debate with Richard. Dan Egan and uncle Jeff try to keep Jonah from relying too much on his trademark ‚Äúzingers,‚Äù like when he answers a question about the debt ceiling by quoting ‚Äúthe late Lionel Richie‚Äù (who‚Äôs not actually dead). The   Mr. Ryan responds by saying it‚Äôs not fair that Richard ‚Äúgets to be the easier person, and I have to be me. ‚Äù So yes, it‚Äôs fun to see Jonah get knocked down hard yet again at the end of this episode, even if its at the hands of political operatives as odious as Teddy and Bill Ericsson. On the flip side, in classic ‚ÄúVeep‚Äù style, multiple characters get comeuppances they don‚Äôt deserve. Poor Mike McLintock drops awkward hockey metaphors into his news conferences, in hopes of schmoozing his way into a gig as a director of communications with the N. H. L.  ‚Äî   thus escaping the toxic White House atmosphere before he and his wife start their family. Instead, he finds out at the ball that a former Meyer administration scapegoat has already landed the job. Meanwhile, when Gary‚Äôs unexpectedly included on the list of Washington‚Äôs ‚Äú50 Hottest Staffers‚Äù (at No. 21!) he lords it over his colleagues, only to find out later that the publication confused him with another Gary. As viewers, is the abject humiliation of two basically decent guys mitigated by Selina‚Äôs success? That‚Äôs always the question with ‚ÄúVeep. ‚Äù Make no mistake: Selina is not a good person, something we again see in the way she treats her daughter, Catherine: first by asking if she‚Äôs planning to be ‚ÄúEllen or Jodie Foster‚Äù in her level of openness about her new lesbian relationship, then by constantly insulting her hair at the ball. (Nothing better encapsulates Selina‚Äôs casual cruelty to Catherine than the way she criticizes her daughter‚Äôs loose hair ‚Äútentacles‚Äù in one scene, and after the strands are secured, gripes, ‚ÄúExcept it‚Äôs still just a rat‚Äôs nest in the back. ‚Äù) The brilliance of ‚ÄúVeep,‚Äù though, rests in how it elicits sympathy for Selina simply by showing what she has to deal with every day. In ‚ÄúCongressional Ball‚Äù she spends an evening sucking up to congressmen and congresswomen, who all make dopey demands in exchange for their support in the tiebreaking presidential vote. She promises the same cabinet appointments to multiple people, and has to nod approvingly when one Montanan makes his pitch for a Sept. 11 memorial in Bozeman (to salute the local first responders who were traumatized by what happened to the first responders in New York). And while she‚Äôs   this bunch, she‚Äôs always keeping one eye on Tom James, her presumptive vice president who‚Äôs also working the room, trying to get those backing Selina to abstain from the vote. His plan is to manipulate the House vote into another tie, which would throw the election to the Senate, where procedural arcana could catapult him to the presidency. That‚Äôs what sets up the episode‚Äôs thrilling bit of political jujitsu as Selina sidles up to each of her backstabbers one by one, letting them know just how badly she could hurt them if they disappoint her. She saves her most savage takedown for Tom, whom she literally dances with in front of the news media while quietly whispering in his ear all the dirt she has. Then she takes him back to her office, yells at him some more and has sex with him. The speed, fury and totality of Selina‚Äôs power move is a joy to watch, even though  ‚Äî   if we‚Äôre being honest  ‚Äî   Tom would probably make a better president. This series toys with our sympathies in that way, pushing us to root for the undeserving and all because when the narrative of politics gets reduced to a horse race, we can‚Äôt help but cheer a win. A lot has been written about what ‚ÄúVeep‚Äù has to say about the destructiveness and pettiness of American governance. But in episodes like this one, the show is just as revealing about our basest instincts as voters.",Foregin,
"On Thursday‚Äôs episode of ‚ÄúThe Dr. Oz Show,‚Äù Donald J. Trump told Dr. Mehmet Oz that he didn‚Äôt get much exercise these days. This is not really true. Even as he said it, he was in the middle of conducting a   spinning class. Mr. Trump‚Äôs   appearance came in the midst of a news week focused on the presidential candidates‚Äô health. And Mr. Trump, the former host of ‚ÄúThe Apprentice,‚Äù   it like a   reveal. After days of    ‚Äô  as to whether Mr. Trump would provide the findings of a recent physical examination, daytime‚Äôs favorite doctor walked the candidate through a   which Mr. Trump, as is his wont when   answered favorably. If you feel so confident, Dr. Oz finally asked, ‚ÄúWhy not share your medical records?‚Äù Mr. Trump responded like a knee to the tap of a mallet, producing two sheets of paper from his jacket as if they were the results of a dramatic elimination episode. The moment set off Mr. Trump‚Äôs showman‚Äôs instinct to engage the crowd. ‚ÄúI have it right here,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúShould I do it?‚Äù Spoiler alert: He did. The move seemed to take Dr. Oz by surprise. He read over the letter quickly and approvingly, at one point interjecting, ‚ÄúMy goodness!‚Äù (He did later point out that Mr. Trump is overweight.) He commended Mr. Trump for participating. ‚ÄúIn this modern era,‚Äù Dr. Oz said, ‚Äúpeople expect to know enough about the people they‚Äôre voting for. ‚Äù What Mr. Trump provided, it turned out, was a cursory summary of test results and other basic information, from the same personal physician who supplied him a bizarre, laudatory testimonial late last year. But for the nationwide audience, he created the impression of having been checked over and given a clean bill of health by the most famous surgeon in syndication. ‚ÄúI view this as, in a way, going to see my doctor,‚Äù Mr. Trump said. He left the appointment with much more than a lollipop. The man whom Oprah Winfrey called ‚ÄúAmerica‚Äôs doctor‚Äù had become, wittingly or not, Mr. Trump‚Äôs spin doctor. The pairing made perfect showbiz sense. Dr. Oz has come to represent popular medical authority in the same way that Mr. Trump, through such platforms as ‚ÄúThe Apprentice,‚Äù symbolizes business acumen. Dr. Oz may have come under fire for pushing supplements and ‚Äúmiracle‚Äù fixes Mr. Trump may have suffered bankruptcies. But their branding speaks louder. The ‚ÄúDr. Oz‚Äù visit was announced last week. But when Hillary Clinton left the campaign trail with pneumonia after abruptly departing Sunday‚Äôs Sept. 11 memorial ceremony, the appearance became doubly strategic. First, because the Clinton campaign delayed explaining her illness, it was a chance to portray Mr. Trump as the more forthcoming, even though Mrs. Clinton has released more detailed medical information. (Both have provided less than some past nominees.) Whether on taxes or medical history, Mr. Trump has been far from a transparent candidate. But he plays one on TV. Second, it underlined the    campaign theme that Mr. Trump has the most, you know, ‚Äústamina. ‚Äù At a rally on Wednesday, he questioned whether Mrs. Clinton (who is on her second national campaign) could make it through the speech he was giving. In case that was too nuanced, Mr. Trump‚Äôs medical letter included a reading of his testosterone level. The message  ‚Äî   as Mr. Trump said in a March debate regarding another physical aspect of his masculinity  ‚Äî   was, ‚ÄúI guarantee you there‚Äôs no problem. ‚Äù The visit‚Äôs beneficial side effects included outreach to the largely female daytime audience, in front of a friendly questioner. Mr. Trump‚Äôs daughter Ivanka joined him to plug his child care policy, without   questions on, say, the criticism that the plan gives more help to   families. Mr. Trump defended his past sexist banter on the Howard Stern radio show  ‚Äî   ‚ÄúI was having fun‚Äù  ‚Äî   and managed to get in a couple of digs at his opponent. When Dr. Oz asked him not to discuss Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Trump agreed, then added, ‚ÄúWe want her to get well. ‚Äù (‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think you can represent the country properly if you‚Äôre not a healthy person,‚Äù he said later.) But by the time the episode was broadcast, the important part of the show, for Mr. Trump‚Äôs purposes, was already over. Because he taped the appearance Wednesday, Mr. Trump gained a day‚Äôs worth of news clips showing him handing over two pages of  ‚Äî   something  ‚Äî   to the celebrity doctor and credulous headlines reporting his disclosure as the release of ‚Äúmedical records. ‚Äù Invested in the story, but without access to the information, news media grasped for snippets. ‚ÄúAudience Member: Dr. Oz Impressed With Trump‚Äôs Health,‚Äù read a chyron on CNN. It was the theater of transparency masquerading as actual transparency  ‚Äî   a placebo. Now that Mr. Trump‚Äôs doctor‚Äôs letter has been released publicly, medical experts and journalists can assess what and how much it tells us  ‚Äî   most likely, to less attention. But the episode showed that the   instincts of America‚Äôs    are quite healthy. In this news cycle‚Äôs journey to Oz, Mr. Trump was the man behind the curtain.",Foregin,

The reason that American police love just shooting people instead of actually working and risking their safety for the safety of the people is because they are blood thirsty cowboy dirty Harry brain washed psychopaths that love killing. It is American culture at the root, deep in the psyche. 
The police have been militarized. They dont do the job like in the old days. No more negotiators, Drs or counselling at the scene of the crisis, its just shoot bang bang boom yourr dead if you had a gun, knife, glow stick, sandwich, whatever. Gary Honeycutt 
How old are you? The old days you mention with negotiators and counselors came into vogue nationally in the 60‚Äôs, after a period of democrat rule notable for their most outstanding ‚Äúaccomplishment‚Äù: a huge escalation of criminals rights over those of victims. Note the escalation of crime since then. It seems you are also on the anti-cop bandwagon. I support them being able to defend themselves. Mistakes can be made in a split second, the same amount of time it might take for a criminal to kill a cop. I‚Äôm sure you can name victims of cops, do you realize what a small percentage of interactions between cops and the public they constitute? Unfortunately, the justified shootings like the Ferguson case are unfairly included in many of our perceptions. First and foremost: don‚Äôt commit crime. That improves your odds drastically. Next, comply with orders given by the police. If you were raised to treat the police as hostile someone failed you. Guilty or innocent, comply! The police are just trying to do their job, don‚Äôt complicate it. I‚Äôve seen many an arrest where a person taunts and struggles with the police even up to resisting being put in the car. Try walking a mile in their shoes. They are trying to keep the public safe and they have a right to be safe themselves. fluffnik 
‚ÄúGuilty or innocent, comply!‚Äù 
Land of the free? 
Most places are successfully policed by consent, and without shooting their citizens or suffering much crime. Gary Honeycutt 
Yes, if an officer wants to see identification he has a reason. If he wants you to keep your hands in plain sight he has a reason. He is possibly ruling you out as a person of interest that was seen in the area. Imagine how much more efficiently that would go if each person would refrain from shouting about their rights for 40 minutes before complying. If you are the person in question the transaction could be handled in a couple of minutes and you‚Äôll be gone without any violence or hard feelings. If you pay taxes you will have helped us get our moneys worth. Of course, if you‚Äôve seen the news and the reality shows You may have the impression that a lot of these guys that are giving a cop a load of crap probably live off of what you are paying to the government. Mike 
Wasn‚Äôt raised hostile to cops, family members are cops as a matter of fact. This is America. If I‚Äôm not committing a crime, or suspected of it, don‚Äôt ask me for papers. Don‚Äôt detain me. Don‚Äôt run DUI checkpoints. Those are infringements on all of our freedom, which I assume we love. Safety is what the left uses to excuse their behavior. Safety is a fallacy. dufas_duck 
I have had 5 police officers in my extended family. It got to the point that none of them were welcome into the rest of the family‚Äôs homes. They were eventually never invited to family get to gathers. They were rude, overbearing, malicious individuals, constantly bragging how they screwed some person and taught them how the world really should be. Their treatment of family members were more along the line of petty dictators where no matter the subject, some familly member was wrong. Petty things like they didn‚Äôt like the car they bought, or their haircut, or the job they worked at‚Ä¶. They were not satisfied with anything or anybody‚Ä¶ 
They brought their street attitude home with them. They couldn‚Äôt keep wives or husbands or significant others for very long. They were arrogant, mean, and only thaought of themselves..anybody else was in their way‚Ä¶. 
I have seen gang members that have more ethics than these police and their freinds‚Ä¶.. Gary Honeycutt 
My great-grandfather, his son-in-law (my grandfather)and his son, my uncle were all cops, the oldest and youngest for their whole careers. All deeply religious, highly moral men. dufas_duck 
That is great, if they were straight arrow, we need more like them. My cop relatives and their friends would fit right in in the Crips, the Bloods, or just about any outlaw motorcycle club. No one but other cops were ‚Äòproud‚Äô of them. My family sure wasn‚Äôt proud of them‚Ä¶ Gary Honeycutt 
Maybe they became hardened by what they faced daily? East side of Detroit? South side of Chicago? People are products of their environment. Maybe the cops in Branson, Mo. and such places are nice guys. What is the ratio of cops to citizens? Let‚Äôs say you‚Äôve got a playground with 60 10 year olds. You get a dozen 10 year olds to keep order among them. If the 60 are from Sierra Leone and the dozen are American boy scouts there‚Äôd be 12 dead Americans in short order. Any dead among the 60 would‚Äôve been killed by their own. So what do we expect of cops who grew up without a rap sheet, graduated from school and passed the academy. You think 10 years of patrolling the gnetto might change them? They surely know the realities of the job better than we do. How do the ones who aren‚Äôt in Mayberry do a 20 or 30 year career in an inner city where shooting a cop makes you a hero and not resisting arrest makes you a pussy? dufas_duck 
I do know that where I grew up, the police at least tried to keep the officers from getting street hardened. They rotated officers to different districts every month. But then, they found thst the police were trading assignments. Some cops didn‚Äôt want to rotate out. They wanted to stay where they were‚Ä¶ No explaination was given by any officer,[at least publically, no answer was given..] 
Many thought the cops were up to no good and wanted to stay in their own area to protct their interst‚Ä¶ dufas_duck 
You just gave the cops an excuse to act like gang members‚Ä¶. Gary Honeycutt

You haven‚Äôt checked out what school cops have been doing as of late then‚Ä¶? A 5 year old in handcuffs or throwing an 8 year old to the ground doesn‚Äôt work out to be the way to increase trust among the populace‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ Anthony Fredericks 
I will end this stupidity of your right now GARY. I work with Police EVERY single day as a EMT. EVERY DAY! I am a qualified expert on how Police act on scene‚Ä¶Most of them are VERY arrogant, Rude and aggressive towards people. SHUT UP!! or BE QUIET!! is the first thing you normally hear from a cop, You ALWAYS see them put someone on the ground. Even if that person is the one who called them for help. If they don‚Äôt like you..BOOM! face down, knee on your neck, cuffs on. Approximately 25% are not like this. But the other 75% are. THIS IS REALITY GARY! And I have worked in SEVERAL cities in different areas‚Ä¶And it is all the same. Police are overbearing and have a chip on their shoulder against the general public‚Ä¶And a lot of them take it out physically on them. Gary Honeycutt 
My sympathies for the flaw in your family‚Äôs DNA. dufas_duck 
Luckily, the flaw was only in the extended family tree‚Ä¶inlaws, marriages, etc‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ ;-> Gary Honeycutt 
Most people who oppose DUI checkpoints have a reason. I‚Äôve always seen a problem with bars having parking lots when it is illegal for good reason to drink and drive. I don‚Äôt mind providing my ID when a cop asks for it. When it‚Äôs done without giving him any lip it is over quickly without incident. He‚Äôs just trying to do the job we are paying for. If you want to launch into a 40 minute tirade about your rights you‚Äôll be there 40 minutes longer, make it a bad night at work for the cop and wind you all up, maybe you like that. Some people love drama. Mike 
The reason is, it‚Äôs an infringement on your rights, and unnecessarily exposes you AND the Officers to a potentially dangerous confrontation. There is no way you believe that *unwanted* contact that is forced upon Officers and the public increases their safety. I wouldn‚Äôt blame the Officers for the policies they have to enforce, however the higher ups never pay when things go wrong after the fact. The problem with being law abiding is that by doing nothing wrong, you don‚Äôt see the infringement of your rights, and tolerate them. Just because you aren‚Äôt guilty of anything, doesn‚Äôt mean your rights aren‚Äôt being taken from you. What if ‚Äúfor safety‚Äù we decided that all firearms need removed from private citizens? What if we decided that TSA should run mandatory random checkpoints all over the US, creating 2 hour delays? What if we decided that anyone that supports Trump may be a violent extremist and should be stopped for questioning? Do you see where this goes? 
I don‚Äôt like the immigration ones inside the states of the Southwest, I don‚Äôt like the ‚Äúagricultural‚Äù ones into California, and I don‚Äôt like the DUI checkpoints in the South. I‚Äôm a legal resident, don‚Äôt transport crops, and don‚Äôt drink, yet I oppose all of them. The idea behind them is well-meaning, the execution is unlawful IMO. Obviously the courts don‚Äôt think so, or they‚Äôd not exist. Gary Honeycutt 
It is the officers job to initiate that confrontation despite the risk to himself. He does it to lessen the chance that a drunk will run over you daughter at a crosswalk. He stops people who fit the description of a wanted person in hopes of catching a criminal before he claims another victim, perhaps raping your daughter. What would you do in his place? Mike 
You are confusing the issues here. Zero issue stopping and talking with someone who is suspected or witnessed committing a crime. 
DUI checkpoints are 100% stop and question, with zero probable cause. Have you been in states where they run these? The road is barricaded, even turning around prior to the checkpoint leads to confrontation with the police as you are ASSUMED to be committing a crime for not wanting to be questioned. You are within your rights to be polite and refuse the checkpoint, but the fact that they exist trouble me. As do any checkpoints, as they are not based on probable cause. Gary Honeycutt 
And you‚Äôve seen these checkpoints at 1pm by a suburban Baptist church? No! The probable cause lies In them being near ‚Äúthe strip‚Äù at 1am where there is a history of alcohol-related incidents. Mike 
I lived in the South, these things were not targeting a specific demographic as far as I could tell, and while not at 1PM that I can recall, they weren‚Äôt that late, and they sure could have been in front of a baptist church. I could have been naive about who was being targeted (I wasn‚Äôt just waived through once they saw my skin color), but my point is that the location doesn‚Äôt matter, nor does the target demographic, if there is one. They are unjust, and just like every other forced interaction with law enforcement, does not serve to increase the safety of LEO‚Äôs. 
If police pull me over because a car that looks like mine just robbed a quickie mart, or a guy like me was just reported for beating his wife or ran off with a kid, I do not have a problem with that. They have probable cause, and the risk to their safety and mine is worth it, because they may be stopping a criminal. Stop me, detain me for a reasonable time until they can prove I am or am not who they are looking for, then let me be on my way. 
However, I‚Äôve been stopped in a rural area for making a right turn on red (perfectly legal in my state) and the officer was a complete ass. Enough that had I a short fuse, it could have quickly escalated. After that encounter, and talking with the state about why the previously posted ‚Äúno turn on red sign‚Äù had been removed from that intersection for a couple of months, the fact that this officers supervisor backed him up for an unlawful stop, and threatening that they could have written me up and I would have to prove in court I didn‚Äôt break the law, just proved to me that SOME police are uninterested in doing what is right depending on the circumstances. That officer had no reason to stop me (although I suspect since it was near his house, and he is a rural county officer, he couldn‚Äôt control his road rage) and by doing so, he put himself at risk, as well as me. There are a million ‚Äúwhat ifs‚Äù in that situation, not the least of which was the fact that even though he pulled me over in the dark, along a fairly rural road, by himself, he didn‚Äôt call in the stop, which is procedure for that department. I could have ended up shot, or he could have, and dispatch would have never known. 
Increasing negative interaction with the public, is never in a LEO‚Äôs best interest for safety and reputation of the police as a whole. dufas_duck 
I guess that‚Äôs why the police looking for a skinny Black man that is wearing a white sweatshirt and is 6 foot that just commited a robbery would shoot a short 5foot 5 kid wearing a dark gray sweat shirt in the back as he was walking down the sidewalk at a fast pace. Turned out that the man they shot was pizza delivery in a hurry to deliver the next order before it cooled off. 
Police shooting two small white females in a light blue pickup truck while the cops were looking a huge black man in a dark gray pickup truck is perfectly A-OK. 
In the town that I live in, police shot and killed a 15 year old kid while he slept‚Ä¶ Maybe we should all congraduate the officer because he only used three bullets, he could have emptied his clip‚Ä¶ 
Maybe the cops that you love are making things more efficient by killing anyone and everyone to save the taxpayers that you are so worried about any money. A couple of bullets is cheaper than some cop‚Äôs time to find out what really is going on.. 
Of course, some of those evil people‚Äôs relitives will probably sue, but so what, the tax payers will take care of that.. 
How do you feel about cops who demand sex from some random female and when she refuses, gets arrested for your ‚Äònon-compliance‚Äô‚Ä¶ 
You would love my uncle. He was a cop and really got off when he could beat or kill someone. After about fifteen years of bullying, beating, killing, and making false charges against people, the force finally fired him‚Ä¶meanwhile, he ruined hundreds of lives and they were not you welfare people that he abused, it was anybody he could screw with‚Ä¶ 
But, in your mind, police can do no wrong..maybe you are right, police are always telling us that they never do anything wrong, especialy when they investigate themselves or have a friendly agency do the investigation‚Ä¶.. Gary Honeycutt 
I don‚Äôt deny that there are a small percentage of cops that shouldn‚Äôt be or wrong split-second decisions sometimes. Think about how many police officers there have been over the span of time you draw your examples from. Think about the number of times per day that an LEO comes in contact with a citizen. That taken into account, bad contacts are extremely rare. The sensationalism of all these female teachers having sex with students is stuck in everyones mind but they don‚Äôt consider the huge number of teachers and students and note how statistically rare these incidents are. The incidents don‚Äôt sour me on the entire education system. We need law enforcement. You are good at pointing out the flaws but do you have a solution? Will any form of policing be perfect? What is? dufas_duck 
How about having honest police and policing. While percentage wise, there is a small number of truley bad cops‚Ä¶.. But, [there is always a but]‚Ä¶ A large percentage of your ‚Äògood‚Äô cops will keep silent, lie, or even cover for the bad cops. That extends up through the ranks to the top of the police forces. Those honest cops that do come forward are setting themselves up to fail and eventually destroy their careers..cops don‚Äôt like whistleblowers. 
The example you used, teachers having sex with students is perfect. Once it is found that a teacher has crossed the line, even a suspicion that the teacher has done something will bring immeadiate consequenses. Not so within the police. A bad policeman can get away with things multiple times, sometimes going on for years. The upper eschalon figures out ways to cover for the errant cop at almost every turn. Even if convicted, the court system will come in later on appeal and remove parts or all of any punishment. 
For years, the public was kept in the dark about ‚Äòthe bad cop‚Äô. Very few were brought to justice. Only the very extreme cases of crooked cops were adjudicated. It is just lately, after public attention, that the police are starting to somewhat clean house. 
There are child molesting police officers that are still working as officers. Many are just put on probation, others are allowed to retun to police work after their incarceration. 
It would also be a boon to the public if we had a justice system instead of a legal system. A legal system can be whatever it‚Äôs practicinors want it to be. A justice system looks for truth no matter where it points to. Quilified and absolute immunity for police, DAs, judges does not lend itself to anything close to ‚Äòjustice‚Äô‚Ä¶.. 
Police are a necessary evil‚Ä¶the are some evil people in the world, it is just too bad that many of them are police officers. Gary Honeycutt 
Keep silent, lie, or even cover? Turn off the TV and go out i to the world. Some will agree with you but if you‚Äôd said the same thing about black people there‚Äôd be trouble. Don‚Äôt you think just about any group might share the same likelihood of bending the rules? They also don‚Äôt like criminals in uniform and are just as likely to line up against a bad apple. Do cops get away with small indiscretions and occassionally a major crime? Probably, but more so than the general population? Interesting take on the teacher thing. I remember a fellow who got a job as a girls basketball coach at a very small rural school. He was no prize in his youth and I guess when an equally awkward underage player on his team developped a crush on him he couldn‚Äôt resist. She got pregnant. And to add to a volatile situation, her uncle was the superintendent of schools! Flash ahead maybe 10 years give or take and I‚Äôm a teacher and football coach in that same system at a slightly larger rural school. I work with a married couple, both tenured teachers, probably on full retirement now after full careers without ever being fired, downsized, transferred, or any of the other things that may befall teachers during their careers. The hubby is the boys basketball coach and unofficially the assistant principle. Guess who? Yep! dufas_duck 
I‚Äôve been out in the world for over 75 years. Been beat by cops and then have them later discover I wasn‚Äôt the perp they were looking for. I was only lucky in that the cops didn‚Äôt make up charges to cover their tails., they just lied about what went down and covered for each other. In this instance, everything happened because I was driving the same make, model, color, and year of vehicle that was used in a felony crime. On the way to jail, a radio message came in telling the cops to stand down, the perp had been caught and identified. The cops just turned around and dumped me back at my vehicle‚Ä¶. 
I think if you would re-read what I posted, It was the cops that I refered to as being giged for turning in another cop, not the teachers. In todays world, a teacher will be messed with just on a rumer. If you as a coach had rumers that you were messing with the kids, I don‚Äôt think you would have lasted in that position‚Ä¶unless you are stating you were messing with the kids and no on ratted on you??? Gary Honeycutt 
No, I wasn‚Äôt referring to myself. I was an outsider where the good ol‚Äô boy superintendent had a slew of relatives and even more buddies on the payroll. I think the guy in my story should‚Äôve done time and never been allowed to work with kids again. dufas_duck 
Addendum: 
I get the feelig[?] that you are the type that if a policeman makes a mistake, the officer should get a pass because everybody makes mistakes. Police are supposed to be trained on how to back off those split second decisions. Even in the military, soldier makes a mistake and if it is not covered up, the soldier faces the consequenses‚Ä¶ But, there are many that think that the killing some kid by a policeman is A-OK. Like the two policemen that were canvassing a nieghborhood, knocking on doors and a 13 year old kid opens the door while holding a PS3 game controller. Cop shouts gun and 13 shots later‚Ä¶an innocent kid is dead and bleeding out in his own home while the Playstation is running in the background and the cops get another pass‚Ä¶. That‚Äôs the kind of policing that you want?? 
Yet, a mechanic makes a mistake while repairing or sevicing your vehicle and it leads to a death of an innocent person‚Ä¶the mechanic can be held liable‚Ä¶ Both were mistakes‚Ä¶why should a mechanic be held responsible and the cop not be?? Anthony Fredericks 
There‚Äôs NO EXCUSE for killing a person Gary!!! We have laws against that! No ‚Äúi‚Äôm Sorry‚Äù brings back people after being killed by over reacting cops. NO! GARY! accidents like that are NOT! EXCUSABLE!!! I don‚Äôt care what job you have. Soldiers in warzones who kill innocent people are brought up on charges of murder. Why would it be o.k. for a stupid beat cop to be able to do it??? Gary Honeycutt 
Self-defense is a valid reason, and the police have as much right to it as anyone and more likelihood to find themselves in that situation due to the nature of their jobs. People like to argue the case of an unarmed attacker. Should only MMA champions be allowed to be cops? An unarmed attacker can kill you. If someone breaks into my house at night I will do whatever it takes to keep him from doing harm to myself or family, I will not wait to see if he‚Äôs armed or ask his intentions. I won‚Äôt refrain from using a weapon because I don‚Äôt see him with one. It is not a high school wrestling match. We won‚Äôt get up and shake hands after it is decided by score. If this same criminal finds me awake and decides to leave at once I will call a cop. It is his job to confront this person and resistance by the suspect places him in the same situation I was in when someone invaded my home. fluffnik 
I live in Scotland where the police do not routinely carry guns, mostly no-one dies. Anthony Fredericks 
You mean like the guy who got shot in his car for trying to give his I.D. to the cop? Or maybe you are talking about the social worker that was trying to bring back his Autistic patient and the com while he was on his back with his hands straight in the air? How about those huh GARY!?!?!? I could go on and on but a close minded sheep like you would never see the forest through the trees‚Ä¶. Anthony Fredericks 
SO Gary if I seen you walking towards me on the street, Got scared because you LOOKED dangerous and I ‚Äúaccidentally‚Äù defended myself by blowing your head off, Then all I have to say is ‚Äúoh, sorry my bad‚Äù and because accidents happen everything is o.k. right? Take your head out of the sand‚Ä¶Police kill people when they think their AUTHORITY is being challenged not their lives. They are protecting their ego‚Äôs. Mike 
While I won‚Äôt disagree completely with your statement, blanket statements are never correct. SOME police may kill from challenges to authority. In most cases it is a kill or be killed split second decision that we, not being in the exact same position, should not second guess. What we SHOULD be second-guessing, are the supervisors, chiefs, and elected officials who hire bad cops, improperly train their officers, and put officers in harms way where they should not be. The higher-ups NEVER pay the price for those under them, whose actions they are responsible for. That is a very real problem. If we want change, we need to hold our elected officials responsible for the behavior of the officers that indirectly work for them. 
Programs such as stop and frisk, checkpoints, etc., all require a confrontation with individuals that do not need to occur. That puts officers and the public‚Äôs lives at risk, neither is acceptable. The easy solution is to stop making the confrontations occur. But you do something stupid (Michael Brown) you deserve what you get. 
I wish organizations like black lives matter would pick individuals to use as martyrs who were actually victims. There are a lot of people who would agree with some of the basic ideas espoused. But when you choose the perpetrators of crime who just happened to get theirs as your martyrs, you expose your cause as being about something other than justice. Gary Honeycutt 
You can put that example back where you pulled it from‚Ä¶if your head isn‚Äôt in the way. BJ 
That‚Äôs actually standard in every part of the world except USA. It‚Äôs normal for police to protect and serve ‚Äì it is not normal for police to shoot first, ask later‚Ä¶ Jack McCauley

"Orange County received a more rain than it receives in one year over the course of four days of torrential downpours this week, leaving   reservoirs full again. [According to the Orange County Register, Irvine Lake rose 6 feet in one week and Barbara‚Äôs Lake was full again after being dry for the past year. Further, the Register reported that a review of reservoirs on the east side of the Santa Ana Mountain range on Thursday found Lake Skinner 85 percent full Diamond Valley Lake 72 percent full and Lake Mathews 90 percent full.  Just six months ago, those same lakes were reportedly dry. Nearly one year ago, Irvine Lake was forced to close its waters to recreational fishing after being a fishing hot spot for over 70 years. It is likely fishing activities will resume there in the near future. While the federal government‚Äôs U. S. Drought Monitor reported that approximately 35 percent of the state has exited the drought, it noted that ‚Äúgroundwater aquifers in many parts of the state remain severely overdrafted and will take far longer to recover. ‚Äù Two weeks ago, roughly 350 billion gallons of water came pouring into the region‚Äôs biggest reservoirs, boosting storage to levels not seen in years. Following that downpour, the U. S. Drought Monitor announced that 42 percent of California had been lifted out of the drought. That figure has likely increased as a result of the succeeding rains. While Northern California was almost completely   Southern California still has a a way to go. Jerry Vilander, general manager for the Serrano Water District, which oversees the Santiago Creek Reservoir (i. e.  Irvine Lake) told the Register that while four days of rain was equivalent to paying for three to four months of   water, ‚ÄúFor the drought to be truly over we need a few more years‚Äô supply in our pocket. ‚Äù Residents are still urged to use water frugally and judiciously.

"For the last hour, the American gunship had been circling high above the city, carefully observing its target with   vision sensors and waiting for clearance to strike. It was 2 in the morning on Oct. 3, 2015, and Kunduz City was enveloped in total darkness. The city‚Äôs power had gone out five days before  ‚Äî   soon after the Taliban took over the provincial capital, in a humiliating blow to the American and Afghan governments  ‚Äî   and it stayed off through the bitter fighting that followed, as commandos from both nations counterattacked. The aircraft‚Äôs target, a distinctively   shaped building set on an expansive lawn, was lit by generators, a beacon in the   out city. As they prepared to fire, the gunship‚Äôs crew members radioed to the ground force commander, a United States Army Special Forces major, for more information. ‚ÄúLooking for confirmation on which building to strike  ‚Äî   Confirm it is the large,   shaped building . .. in the center of the compound. Affirm. ‚Äù An   circles its target like a ball swung from a string, raining down gunfire along the radius. At 2:08 a. m. the gunship began its assault, starting on the eastern end of the   shaped building and working methodically west. For half an hour, the   fired its   millimeter howitzer, the largest airborne gun in existence, and its   millimeter Bofors cannon, which shoots exploding incendiary rounds and is ideal for hunting people who flee targeted buildings by foot, often referred to by pilots as ‚Äúsquirters. ‚Äù There were about 50 squirters at the site, the crew noted, a surprisingly high number. Through the infrared scope, the building glowed as it burned, while ghostly shapes that flitted from inside were gunned down. ‚ÄúWe started a fire, good effects. ‚Äù At roughly the same time, 150 miles south in Kabul, Guilhem Molinie, the head of the Afghan mission for Doctors Without Borders, known by its French initials, M. S. F. was woken by a phone call: His hospital in Kunduz was burning. A few minutes later, he received a chilling update: It was being bombed from the air. That could mean only an American or Afghan attack. He began frantically calling the United States military, the United Nations, anyone who might be able to make it stop. At 2:19 a. m. he spoke to an officer at the Army Special Forces headquarters at Bagram Air Base, who said he would investigate. The airstrike would continue for an additional 18 minutes. The officer later texted Molinie: ‚ÄúI‚Äôll do my best, praying for you all. ‚Äù By the time the sun rose, the hospital‚Äôs main building was a smoldering ruin. It had been leveled with devastating precision the other buildings on the compound, some no more than a few dozen feet away, were left unharmed. According to M. S. F. at least 42 people were killed in the attack and dozens injured. It was among the most shocking massacres in the   led war in Afghanistan, and certainly the most baffling. Why would an American warplane destroy a working hospital full of doctors and patients? On April 29, seven months after the bombing, the United States military released a heavily redacted version of its investigation into the airstrike. The report asserts that it was an accident, a result of equipment failures and bad decisions on the part of the gunship crew and the Special Forces. ‚ÄúThe investigation concluded that the personnel involved did not know they were striking a medical facility,‚Äù Gen. Joseph Votel, the head of the military‚Äôs Central Command, said at a news conference. ‚ÄúThey were absolutely trying to do the right thing. ‚Äù Even taken at face value, the report reveals more than a simple error. The circumstances that led to the destruction of the hospital are a direct result of how the Special Forces were made to bear the weight of the United States‚Äô contradictory strategy in Afghanistan, which seeks to both end its involvement in the war and prop up the struggling Afghan government. Restricted to a supposedly noncombat role as advisers, the Special Forces in Kunduz ended up calling in the airstrike, which was in support of Afghan troops against a target a   away, as   which meant that it bypassed many safeguards intended to prevent civilian casualties. Moreover, there is evidence  ‚Äî   both buried in the report and from interviews conducted on the front lines in Kunduz  ‚Äî   that suggests that Afghan troops may have deliberately provided the hospital as a target. Though the Special Forces later said they were unaware that it was the hospital, the redacted investigation documents show that they passed a description that matched the M. S. F. compound to the   as a target  ‚Äî   a fact that the military elides in its summary of the bombing. This description originated from their Afghan partners. In my conversations with them in November in the aftermath of the bombing, some of the Afghan forces in Kunduz, citing false intelligence that the hospital had been taken over by insurgents, said that it had been justifiably targeted. Both the American military and the Afghan government declined to comment on whether Afghan forces had intended to target the hospital. But a question hangs over the Kunduz bombing, even as the military has moved to declare the matter settled: Did Afghan forces, out of longstanding mistrust of M. S. F. draw the United States into a terrible tragedy? When Maj. Michael Hutchinson, known to his friends as Hutch, redeployed last year to Afghanistan, he was sure  ‚Äî   as he later told military investigators  ‚Äî   that getting outside the wire to engage in combat was mostly a thing of the past. The Americans were there to train, advise and assist the Afghans. It was their war now. The American combat mission in Afghanistan had ended in 2014, as announced by President Obama in a Rose Garden speech that year. The remaining American forces were supposed to be restricted to two narrow roles: A noncombat NATO training mission, called Resolute Support, was there to advise Afghan forces, while the American counterterrorism force under Freedom‚Äôs Sentinel was charged with targeting Al Qaeda and the Islamic State. ‚ÄúThe U. S. military will not be engaged in specific operations targeting members of the Taliban just because they‚Äôre members of the Taliban,‚Äù Josh Earnest, the White House spokesman, told reporters in 2014. But as the Afghan government has begun to lose ground against the Taliban, United States forces have found themselves pulled back into combat. Since the new missions began in 2015, at least 87 American military personnel have been killed or wounded in action. Much of that fighting has fallen to Special Operations units like Hutchinson‚Äôs company, which was assigned responsibility for northern Afghanistan under a task force led by the First Battalion, Third Special Forces Group. (Hutchinson‚Äôs name is redacted in the military‚Äôs report, but he is referred to throughout as ‚Äúthe G. F. C. ,‚Äù for ground force commander. His identity was confirmed by Joe Kasper, Representative Duncan Hunter‚Äôs chief of staff, who has been in contact with Special Forces who were in Kunduz. The military declined to comment on Hutchinson‚Äôs role or make him available for an interview.) From the start, Hutchinson had been wary of Kunduz and its messy politics. ‚ÄúIronically, I probably jinxed myself on this,‚Äù he later told military investigators. ‚ÄúI said I did not believe that we should get involved in Kunduz any further than [training and advising] unless the provincial capital falls, because structurally it is such a political and ethnic problem. It‚Äôs not something that we can effectively weigh in on. ‚Äù Kunduz, a fertile wedge of rice and wheat fields tucked between the foothills of the Hindu Kush mountains and the Amu Darya river basin, is one of the provinces where the Taliban have made their biggest inroads in recent years. Yet in the months leading up to the fall of the city, neither the Americans nor the Afghans seemed particularly worried about its stability. On Aug. 13, Brig. Gen. Wilson Shoffner, the United States military‚Äôs spokesman in Afghanistan, was asked about the situation there during a news conference. ‚ÄúI think there‚Äôs been a lot of generalization when it comes to reports on the north,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúKunduz is  ‚Äî   is not now and has not been in danger of being overrun by the Taliban. ‚Äù Roughly six weeks later, around 3 in the morning on Sept. 28, Taliban fighters attacked the city‚Äôs outskirts on three fronts. ‚ÄúThe mujahedeen were united under one command,‚Äù said a Taliban commander who took part in the offensive and goes by the name Shahid. He spoke by phone from outside the city in the weeks after the attack. ‚ÄúWe broke our enemy. ‚Äù Though Kunduz City was home to thousands of Afghan army, police and intelligence personnel, its defenses quickly collapsed, the officers fleeing in disarray to the airport on a plateau overlooking the city. Within hours of their initial assault, the Taliban were freely roaming the streets, looting the abandoned bases of weapons, secret documents, Ford pickup trucks, Humvees and even two old   made   tanks. Thousands of residents jammed the highways as they fled to neighboring cities meanwhile, hordes of Taliban fighters, some from surrounding provinces, streamed into the city, attracted by the prospect of a major victory. It was the first time since 2001 that the Taliban had captured a provincial capital. As panic spread across northern Afghanistan, the Special Forces were tapped to help save Afghanistan‚Äôs   largest city. There was already one group called an Operational Detachment Alpha  ‚Äî   an ‚ÄúA team‚Äù of 12 Green Berets, plus some support troops, including joint terminal attack controllers, who direct airstrikes  ‚Äî   based at the Kunduz airport. An additional Operational Detachment Alpha, plus four operators from a third one, were sent up from Bagram, the main American military base north of Kabul. They arrived around 6 in the morning on Sept. 29, a little more than 12 hours after the city fell. Hutchinson was put in command of the entire force. Afghan reinforcements were also flown in, including a contingent of police special forces and about 200 soldiers from the Afghan Army‚Äôs most elite unit, the Special Operations Force, which was also known by its Pashto initials, K. K. A. and was formerly attached to the United States military‚Äôs secretive Joint Special Operations Command. These coalition troops confronted a scene of total chaos: thousands of security forces and civilian officials clamoring for space on the few evacuation flights available, some casting aside their uniforms and weapons on the road. When the Taliban attacked the airport plateau that evening, the defenders began fleeing the perimeter, but the Special Forces called in airstrikes, which hammered the insurgent forces, breaking their offensive and leaving dozens of dead fighters scattered through the arid hills. ‚ÄúIf the Americans hadn‚Äôt intervened,‚Äù said Col. Abdullah Gard, then the head of the Kunduz police‚Äôs   reaction force, ‚Äúthe airport would have fallen. ‚Äù Earlier that same day, a Toyota Corolla pulled up to the main entrance of the Doctors Without Borders hospital in Kunduz. ‚ÄúThere was a big fat guy driving,‚Äù said an M. S. F. employee who was on duty at the time. ‚ÄúSomeone told me he‚Äôs the big boss of the Taliban. ‚Äù It was Janat Gul, one of the most powerful Taliban leaders in northern Afghanistan. With him was Abdul Salam, the ‚Äúshadow governor‚Äù responsible for Kunduz. Salam and Gul got out and went inside, the employee recalled  ‚Äî   unarmed as per the hospital‚Äôs strict   weapons policy  ‚Äî   to meet with expatriate staff members. (Doctors Without Borders confirmed Salam‚Äôs visit that day but said he didn‚Äôt enter the hospital.) According to Molinie, who was monitoring events from Kabul, the Taliban leadership pledged full cooperation and protection and asked that the hospital stay operational during whatever fighting was to come. ‚ÄúThe message was that we could continue our activities, that we would be safe and protected and that the patients of the hospital would be safe and protected,‚Äù said Molinie, ‚Äúas well as the patients from government forces. ‚Äù The hospital staff activated the   casualty plan and readied for the flood of patients that would soon arrive. For M. S. F. dealing with the Taliban was a routine part of the neutral role it seeks to maintain in Afghanistan. One of the world‚Äôs largest medical charities, M. S. F. sees itself as an impartial humanitarian organization in the mold of the International Committee of the Red Cross, one that could cross front lines to provide treatment to anyone who needed it, including wounded combatants. That role has been getting harder to play. M. S. F. has been active in Afghanistan since 1980 and had worked with both the mujahedeen and Taliban governments. But after the terror attacks of Sept. 11, its ethos of political neutrality contrasted sharply with that of the Global War on Terror, where you were either with the United States and its allies or with the terrorists. Afghan forces have been especially resentful of the fact that as patients, insurgents in M. S. F. facilities are entitled to the protection of international law. In 2004, five M. S. F. staff members were shot in an unsolved murder. A Taliban spokesman claimed responsibility, accusing the organization of serving American interests. But according to M. S. F. Afghan officials presented them with credible evidence that local forces were actually responsible. No action was taken against them by the government, and the organization pulled out of the country. When M. S. F. returned to Afghanistan in 2009, it followed the example of the Red Cross and negotiated its access in the field with the Taliban leadership. Eager for the help of humanitarian groups in responding to the worsening conflict, the United States and Afghan governments acquiesced. ‚ÄúThe initial deal with the Afghan government, with NATO and the U. S.,‚Äù Molinie said, ‚Äúwas that we would reopen a mission on the condition that all parties would accept that we talk to everybody. ‚Äù But balancing the demands of belligerents in a ruthless war was fraught with risk. In its zeal to help Afghans trapped behind the Taliban‚Äôs lines, M. S. F. risked souring its relationship with the Afghan government. One of its more ambitious plans called for opening a hospital in the   held northern part of Helmand Province, along with an airstrip to fly in international staff members and medical supplies behind insurgent lines. ‚ÄúPersonally, I thought the idea was completely insane,‚Äù said a Western official who was briefed on the proposal last year. ‚ÄúThe Afghan government would have reacted strongly against M. S. F. ‚Äù In 2011, M. S. F. opened the hospital in Kunduz, a location it chose because it believed, presciently, that the province‚Äôs bloody past presaged a violent future. But some members of the Afghan government and security forces there had little respect for M. S. F. ‚Äôs neutrality and resented its treatment of wounded Taliban. When I visited Kunduz in November, their anger was still surprisingly raw, despite the recent destruction of the hospital. ‚ÄúThey give them medicine they transport and treat their injured,‚Äù Gard, the commander of the   reaction force, told me. ‚ÄúTheir existence is a big problem for us. ‚Äù And though the hospital treated many more wounded for the government, there were rumors that M. S. F. had carried out unnecessary amputations on them, according to Fawzia Yaftali, a member of the provincial council. ‚ÄúThe general perception was that M. S. F. supported the Taliban,‚Äù she said. On July 1, an episode occurred that should have been, in retrospect, a warning sign for all involved. A team of Afghan police commandos from elite units mentored by United States and NATO special forces  ‚Äî   the 222 and 333 Battalions, which were later part of the Afghan forces sent to Kunduz with the Green Berets  ‚Äî   had arrived in Kunduz Province to track a   value target, a militant commander named Abu Huzaifa. After targeting Huzaifa in an airstrike, the commandos believed that he had been wounded and taken to the M. S. F. hospital in Kunduz City. They drove there and forced their way inside, where they physically assaulted the staff members and fired their weapons into the air, according to M. S. F. Huzaifa was nowhere to be found. ‚ÄúIt was a kind of wild intrusion,‚Äù Molinie said. After M. S. F. phoned the governor and the police chief, the commandos were called off. Furious that the sanctity of the hospital had been violated, M. S. F. closed it to new admissions for five days, until officials received guarantees from Kabul that it would be respected. Huzaifa would be killed seven weeks later  ‚Äî   by an American drone, according to a senior Afghan special forces commander  ‚Äî   but bitterness about the hospital raid lingered among the Kunduz security forces. ‚ÄúThey hid him,‚Äù Gard told me, without offering any evidence. His men had accompanied the police commandos to the hospital. ‚ÄúThe people who work there are traitors, all of them. ‚Äù On Wednesday, Sept. 30, the day after the Taliban‚Äôs assault on the airport was beaten back, Hutchinson started planning an operation to retake the city. The political pressure to do so was made apparent when, before his departure, Hutchinson, along with an Afghan general, spoke by videoconference with Gen. John Campbell, then the commander of American forces in Afghanistan. Campbell, who was in Kabul, was not happy with the Afghans. ‚ÄúGeneral Campbell was understandably upset,‚Äù Hutchinson told investigators. ‚ÄúNot only was it a shock and travesty that they had‚Äù  ‚Äî   what follows is redacted in the military‚Äôs report but seems to refer to how Afghan forces abandoned Kunduz City without a fight. The fall of Kunduz had called into question the viability of Obama‚Äôs strategy in Afghanistan, and storm clouds were gathering in Washington, where Campbell had previously been scheduled to testify before Congress. ‚ÄúHe was very much in a hurry to get back to D. C.,‚Äù Hutchinson says in the report. ‚ÄúHe had a lot on his plate. ‚Äù (Campbell, who is now retired, declined to comment for this article.) After the video conference, Hutchinson briefed his men on what the   general told him. This was a strategically vital mission, and the whole world was watching. ‚ÄúIt had to happen as soon as possible. Failure was not an option on this operation. ‚Äù The operation fit awkwardly under Resolute Support, the noncombat training mission, and Freedom‚Äôs Sentinel, which was supposed to engage only ISIS and Al Qaeda, not the Taliban. Indeed, while Hutchinson had submitted his operation plan to his headquarters at Bagram under Resolute Support, it came back approved under Freedom‚Äôs Sentinel. Later, Hutchinson told investigators that he thought he was operating under Resolute Support‚Äôs rules of engagement. The distinction between the two  ‚Äî   which were both led by Campbell  ‚Äî   would become almost meaningless in Kunduz. The same unit could be carrying out a training mission one minute and a counterterrorism one the next. According to the military, in the first four days of fighting in Kunduz, 13 airstrikes were conducted under Resolute Support and nine under Freedom‚Äôs Sentinel. Before conducting strikes, aircrews would sometimes radio to ask under which mission they were about to shoot. The plan Hutchinson submitted, called Kunduz Clearing Patrol, was a risky mission to strike deep into the city, where his men and the Afghan commandos would take over the police and governor‚Äôs compound and set up a forward stronghold. Hutchinson later admitted that he had underestimated the number of Taliban in the city as ‚Äúa small group of dedicated individuals. ‚Äù The Green Berets planned to stay for only 24 hours, long enough for the local Afghan forces at the airport to rally and return to the city. ‚ÄúI really thought that the Afghans would see that it wasn‚Äôt that big of a deal and they would all come back in,‚Äù he said in the report. ‚ÄúWe all agreed it had to happen fast, and the only people who were willing to go in, unfortunately, were people who did not know the city of Kunduz. ‚Äù That same Wednesday night, around 10:30, according to the report, the Green Berets, accompanied by the Afghan police and army commandos, as well as Gard‚Äôs   reaction force, rolled out of the airfield in a convoy of armored vehicles and fought their way into the city. First they cleared Gard‚Äôs compound, which the insurgents had captured the day before. They were hit by repeated Taliban ambushes and called in airstrikes from a circling   gunship, killing dozens of insurgents. While entering the police compound, they set off a tripwire bomb, but no one was hurt. The Afghan and American commandos posted guards on the walls and set up a base inside. A Humvee with a single   scale map of Kunduz spread over its hood served as the Special Forces‚Äô command post. The city around them was still swarming with insurgents. When the sun rose, the attacks began. Hoping to overrun the police compound‚Äôs defenders, the Taliban launched relentless assaults from the surrounding buildings, sometimes getting close enough for the Green Berets to use grenades. As the insurgents rained rockets and   gun fire on the compound‚Äôs barriers, the Special Forces called in six ‚Äúdanger close‚Äù gun runs from   the strikes near enough to risk friendly fire. Still, the insurgents kept coming. ‚ÄúI was in a lot of effective firefights,‚Äù one of the Green Berets later wrote, ‚Äúbut this was on a completely different level than even any of the experienced special operators on any of the detachments had seen  ‚Äî   particularly over such a sustained period of time. How no one was killed, or even wounded, is an absolute miracle. ‚Äù An Afghan force of 500 was supposed to show up the next day from the airport to relieve them it never did. When a few Afghan police and army personnel did arrive, they said they would abandon their positions if the Americans left. It soon became apparent to Hutchinson and his men that their   mission was going to last longer. By sending the Special Forces to hold an isolated position deep inside a city held by the Taliban, the American military allowed the Afghan government to claim a badly needed propaganda victory. On Oct. 1, as the Green Berets and the Afghan commandos fought for their lives at the police compound, President Ashraf Ghani held a news conference in Kabul to declare that all of Kunduz City had been retaken. ‚ÄúThank God we had no fatalities,‚Äù he said. (In fact, the battle to recapture the city would rage for two more weeks, and at least 38 Afghan police officers and soldiers would be killed.) The fact that the Special Forces were surrounded by Taliban also meant that the liberal use of American air power in Kunduz could be justified as   defense. The military went further by applying what it called Persons With Designated Special Status to the Afghan commandos in Kunduz, a designation that allows American forces to consider temporarily defending certain partnered Afghan troops as part of their own   defense  ‚Äî   essentially,   defense of someone else. Later, investigators would conclude that Hutchinson had improperly used these   defense rules in order to launch offensive ‚Äú  assault fires. ‚Äù It was his response, perhaps, to the conundrum he faced by engaging in combat during a supposedly noncombat mission: Was he supposed to wait for the commandos to get pinned down or take casualties before striking the insurgents they had been sent into the city to fight? ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt expect them to assault that,‚Äù he told investigators, referring to the K. K. A. ‚Äôs subsequent attack on the   held intelligence headquarters. ‚ÄúThey can‚Äôt sit out there and die on the road. ‚Äù Armed with this authorization and ordered to take back the city of Kunduz, the Special Forces called in air support for the Afghan commandos, who, taking advantage of their superior   vision capabilities, would set out from the police compound to raid Taliban positions around the city at night. ‚ÄúWhere there was heavy pressure on us,‚Äù said Yaftali, the K. K. A. commander, ‚Äúwherever there was heavy fighting, we told the Americans to strike there. ‚Äù In a city where all other institutions had been abandoned by their staff, the M. S. F. hospital was a lifeline for the people of Kunduz. Dr. Esmatullah Esmat had been a surgeon for eight years in Afghanistan, but he had never witnessed anything like this. ‚ÄúWhen I saw my patients after surgery and they would say, ‚ÄòDr. Esmat, you saved me,‚Äô I felt energy,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWe never felt tired. ‚Äù A   shouldered, stocky man with a shy smile, Esmat and his fellow surgeons worked in alternating   shifts. Over five days, the hospital would receive 376 patients in its emergency room, more than a quarter of them women and children. Esmat had to amputate the leg of a    girl. ‚ÄúI have a daughter the same age,‚Äù he said. It was a bloody and chaotic scene. In the red room, the most critical cases were prepped  ‚Äî   head and torso wounds, or traumatic amputations, typically  ‚Äî   and then sent immediately into one of the hospital‚Äôs three operating theaters. There, stripped naked under the surgeon‚Äôs lamp, Taliban fighters, civilians and government soldiers alike became patients whose lives needed to be saved. Esmat and his colleagues performed 138 operations during those days, almost a third of them emergency laparotomies  ‚Äî   the abdomen was cut open and internal organs were piled on the chest, so that the surgical team could go through them, painstaking inch by inch, looking for lacerations to suture. As the wards overflowed, the staff laid down mattresses between the beds and in the hallways and stretched the   hospital to fit 130. There were gruesome and strange sights, like the Taliban fighter from a commando unit, in a distinctive   pattern robe, weeping uncontrollably while stroking the head of his   bagged friend. ‚ÄúIt was a bit hopeless,‚Äù said Faizullah Alokozai, the hospital‚Äôs archivist. ‚ÄúI saw a lot of dead children. ‚Äù Though the M. S. F. hospital was crowded with fighters, whether patients or caretakers (each patient was allowed one) staff members and civilians who were present said the insurgents respected the rules. They left their weapons outside or handed them over at the gun lockers at the entrance. One employee recalled seeing a fighter give up his weapon but forget his ammunition vest when the employee nervously approached the fighter about it, the man apologized profusely and handed it over. ‚ÄúWe had respect for the hospital, as they were serving the people,‚Äù said Shahid, the Taliban commander. ‚ÄúI myself went there once when one of our men was wounded, and before entering we submitted our weapons outside. ‚Äù M. S. F. did allow caretakers and patients to keep their cellphones, however, and I was told by several staff members and civilians present that some Taliban caretakers also brought in   radios. (Molinie said that while there was no specific rule against radios, he didn‚Äôt believe that they were allowed in.) According to M. S. F. some of the Taliban patients were   ranking leaders. Taliban vehicles were also allowed inside the hospital grounds to drop off critically injured patients. Unknown to M. S. F. Afghan forces in Kunduz were coming to the false conclusion that the hospital was being used as a Taliban stronghold and headquarters, which would have meant the loss of its protected status. ‚ÄúAll their most important leaders were inside the hospital, especially Tajiks, Uzbeks and   ranking Pakistanis,‚Äù Gard said. He claimed his information came from local informants who had been inside the hospital and witnessed the Taliban operating there. ‚ÄúThey had raised their flag and established their headquarters there. ‚Äù These unconfirmed reports were lent additional weight by signals intelligence. Yaftali, the K. K. A. commander, told me that his unit‚Äôs Wolfhound radio direction finders, which allowed them to determine the range and bearing of enemy radios, picked up Taliban transmissions from inside the hospital. ‚ÄúWe located about 10 to 15 radios from there,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThe Taliban were inside and outside the hospital. ‚Äù The Afghan forces I spoke to said they relayed these reports to the American military, and it‚Äôs clear that, before the strike, some Americans were aware of the concerns that the M. S. F. hospital had been taken over by the Taliban. On Oct. 1, Carter Malkasian, a civilian adviser to the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff at the Pentagon, emailed M. S. F. in New York to ask about the safety of its staff and whether Taliban fighters were ‚Äúholed up‚Äù inside the hospital. Maj. Gen. Mark Quantock, Campbell‚Äôs intelli gence deputy, told investigators: ‚ÄúAlthough we assessed that there were Taliban using the hospital, you cannot shoot up a building under the current authorities. Period. ‚Äù Molinie, M. S. F. ‚Äôs head of mission in Kabul, said he was then unaware of the American military‚Äôs suspicions, which he criticized as baseless. On Sept. 29, he provided Resolute Support with GPS coordinates for four of M. S. F. ‚Äôs facilities in Kunduz, including the hospital, as a precaution. And the day before the bombing, he coordinated the delivery of three truckloads of medical supplies to Kunduz with an officer at the Special Forces‚Äô headquarters at Bagram. ‚ÄúHe informed me of the number of beds, number of international aid workers in the hospital, and that the Taliban were ‚Äòprotecting‚Äô the hospital and were treating the government casualties well,‚Äù the officer later wrote. It‚Äôs unclear from the report what, if anything, the Special Forces on the ground in Kunduz knew about the M. S. F. hospital. Several staff members at their headquarters at Bagram told investigators that they had passed M. S. F. ‚Äôs grid coordinates on two separate occasions to the Green Berets at the police compound. ‚ÄúI know I read the four grids and got a   for accuracy,‚Äù one person wrote. ‚ÄúI think I used the term ‚ÄòDoctors Without Borders,‚Äô not ‚ÄòM. S. F. ‚Äô‚Äôu2009‚Äù Hutchinson and other members of his team, however, said they never received the coordinates from Bagram and were unaware of the hospital‚Äôs location before the strike, a contention the investigators accepted in their final report. But whether they heard the Afghans‚Äô false reports before or after the strike, some of the Green Berets in Kunduz appeared to believe them. ‚ÄúThere were enemy in there,‚Äù one later wrote, according to an email excerpt provided by Representative Hunter‚Äôs office. ‚ÄúThey were using it as a [command and control] node. They had already removed and ransomed the foreign doctors, and they had fired on partnered personnel from there. ‚Äù For the civilians who remained in Kunduz during the fighting  ‚Äî   the United Nations estimates that 13, 000 families were displaced by the fighting and that 848 civilians were killed or injured  ‚Äî   life was a daily struggle to survive. There was no electricity, and the price of basics like bread and cooking oil had shot up, for those who could find them at all. Heading out in search of supplies meant risking your life in the crossfire on the streets. But for people like Ismail Zahir, a   haired,   spoken    who worked in construction, there was no other choice. With his father deaf and disabled, his family relied on their eldest son as their breadwinner. When there were lulls in the fighting, Ismail would head out into the street, dodging sniper fire. ‚ÄúI was afraid,‚Äù he said, ‚Äúbut not as afraid as I was for my family. ‚Äù Once Afghan and American forces counterattacked and airstrikes began hitting the city, he grew especially worried for his sisters Morsal and Madina. Morsal, 15, was quiet and fastidious like him, while Madina, at 5 the youngest in the family, was impish and   cheeked. At night, they screamed in fear when bombs struck nearby. They begged the family to leave Kunduz. Finally, on Oct. 2, the fourth day after the fall of Kunduz, Ismail and a friend set off across the city to find a car to hire, riding tandem on a borrowed bicycle through the deserted streets. Taliban fighters stopped them at a checkpoint but let them pass  ‚Äî   civilians were free to flee if they wished. On the outskirts of the city, they found a taxi driver. He wanted the equivalent of $200 to ta",,

"2,700-year-old Hebrew mention of Jerusalem found Rare papyrus from 7th century B.C. refers to consignment of wineskins Published: 26 mins ago 
(Times of Israel) A rare, ancient papyrus dating to the First Temple Period ‚Äî 2,700 years ago ‚Äî has been found to bear the oldest known mention of Jerusalem in Hebrew. 
The fragile text, believed plundered from a cave in the Judean Desert cave, was apparently acquired by the Israel Antiquities Authority during a sting in 2012 when thieves attempted to sell it to a dealer. Radiocarbon dating has determined it is from the 7th century BCE, making it one of just three extant Hebrew papyri from that period, and predating the Dead Sea Scrolls by centuries. 
The IAA‚Äôs Eitan Klein said the dating of the papyrus had been confirmed by comparing the text‚Äôs orthography with other texts from the period.",Foregin,
"We Are Change 
In perhaps the most disturbing Wikileaks release to date, Tony Podesta (John Podesta‚Äôs brother) is invited to a ‚ÄúSpirit Cooking‚Äù dinner with performance artist Marina Abramovi?.
Dinner with a famous artist might sound deeply mundane, but there is far more to this story.
Abramovi?, 69, is a fairly famous Serbian performance artist, who now lives in New York.
In an email dated June 28, 2015, Abramovi? wrote:
‚ÄúDear Tony,
I am so looking forward to the Spirit Cooking dinner at my place. Do you think you will be able to let me know if your brother is joining?
All my love, Marina‚Äù
Tony then forwarded the email to his brother, John, asking:
‚ÄúAre you in NYC Thursday July 9
Marina wants you to come to dinner
Mary?‚Äù
While this seems like a completely normal and uninspiring email, a look at what ‚Äúspirit cooking‚Äù is, changes things immediately.
In the video, Abramovi? is seen painting the recipe for these ‚Äúspirit dinners,‚Äù using what appears to be thickly congealed blood. The recipe read, at one point, ‚Äúmix fresh breast milk with fresh sperm, drink on earthquake nights.‚Äù

So, we have to ask, did John Podesta‚Äôs brother invite him to go drink semen mixed with breast milk? Yikes. 

Abramovi? is known for her often-gory art that confronts pain and ritual. Her first performance involved repeatedly, stabbing herself in her hands. The next performance featured her throwing her nails, toenails, and hair into a flaming five-point star ‚Äî which she eventually jumped inside of, causing her to lose consciousness.
During the next, she ingested a medication to treat people who are catatonic, which caused violent muscle spasms.
Perhaps most famously, in 1974, Abramovi? placed 72 objects on a table, including a rose, a feather, honey, a whip, olive oil, scissors, a scalpel ‚Äî and a gun and a single bullet. Alongside the items was a sign informing the audience that the items could be used on her in any way that they chose.
For six hours, she remained at the mercy of the audience, allowing them to do as they pleased. During that time, she was stripped, cut, and one audience member even held the gun to her head.
‚ÄúWhat I learned was that ‚Ä¶ if you leave it up to the audience, they can kill you. ‚Ä¶ I felt really violated: they cut up my clothes, stuck rose thorns in my stomach, one person aimed the gun at my head, and another took it away. It created an aggressive atmosphere. After exactly 6 hours, as planned, I stood up and started walking toward the audience. Everyone ran away, to escape an actual confrontation,‚Äù she later said of the performance.
We really just want to know what Podesta had for dinner.

"DOYLESTOWN, Pa.  ‚Äî   Donald J. Trump has been waiting for months for a poll in which he cracks 50 percent of the vote against Hillary Clinton in any of his top battleground states: Florida, New Hampshire, Ohio or Pennsylvania. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôll happen after the conventions,‚Äù he said in a July 6 interview. ‚ÄúBelieve me. ‚Äù But in the last two weeks, instead of attracting a surge of new admirers, Mr. Trump has been hemorrhaging support among loyal Republicans,   independents,   Democrats and others, according to polls and 30 interviews with a   of voters. His dispute with the parents of a Muslim Army captain who was killed in action in Iraq, and his suggestion that ‚ÄúSecond Amendment people‚Äù could somehow stop Mrs. Clinton, have intensified doubts about Mr. Trump even among Americans who were initially attracted to his frank and freewheeling style. For a candidate who once seemed like an electoral phenomenon, with an unshakable following and a celebrity appeal that crossed party lines, Mr. Trump now faces the possibility that his missteps have erected a ceiling over his support among some demographic groups and in several swing states. He has been stuck under 45 percent of the vote in Ohio and Pennsylvania for weeks, polls show, while Mrs. Clinton has gained support. Several Republican voters say they grow leery every time Mr. Trump speaks these days, for fear he will embarrass them, and feel increasingly repelled just when they hoped he might adjust his message to try to draw more people in. ‚ÄúI liked that he was politically incorrect. But now I feel, enough already,‚Äù Trish Grove, a banker, said as she finished lunch at a diner here in Doylestown, a bellwether suburb north of Philadelphia. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs not going to win a majority of voters by sounding offensive and ridiculous. ‚Äù After the conventions in late July, Mrs. Clinton‚Äôs support among young people rose 12 percent, and she gained ground among liberals and moderates, according to an analysis of a New York   News poll before the conventions and a CBS News poll after them. Mr. Trump improved only with voters who held bachelor‚Äôs degrees but did not attend graduate school. ‚ÄúUndecided voters still have a long way to go before they vote for Trump,‚Äù said Frank Luntz, a Republican strategist who holds focus groups with voters. ‚ÄúHe has high unfavorable ratings with so many voters that he would need to win most of the rest of the electorate, and his   problems aren‚Äôt helping him grow. ‚Äù Mr. Trump‚Äôs troubles are perhaps most pronounced in Pennsylvania, which he has targeted for victory in November even though the state has gone Democratic in the last six presidential elections. He is running strong in the traditionally conservative western part of the state, and his advisers argue that his populist views on trade, immigration and foreign policy could resonate with independents and   Democrats. ‚ÄúWe have to win Pennsylvania,‚Äù Mr. Trump said on Friday during a campaign rally in Erie. ‚ÄúWe win Pennsylvania, we‚Äôre going to win it,‚Äù apparently a reference to the presidency. But to carry the state, pollsters say, Mr. Trump would need to beat Mrs. Clinton here in the Philadelphia suburbs, where President Obama defeated Mitt Romney in 2012 by about nine percentage points. (Mr. Obama carried the state by about five points.) Yet Mrs. Clinton holds a wide lead in those suburbs, 52 percent to 26 percent, according to an NBC   Street   College poll published Wednesday. ‚ÄúThere is absolutely no way Trump wins Pennsylvania unless he can broaden his appeal significantly and overcome his huge deficit in the suburbs,‚Äù said G. Terry Madonna, director of the Franklin  Marshall College poll and a longtime analyst of Pennsylvania politics. ‚ÄúHe does well with white   voters, but there simply aren‚Äôt enough of them in Pennsylvania to win. And he can‚Äôt stick with his political message for more than five minutes. ‚Äù Mr. Trump‚Äôs advisers expressed confidence in their strategy and questioned whether public polls fully reflect his support. While some did express concern that there could be a ceiling on his support among women and members of minority groups, they also said he had room to grow among   voters, white men and independents  ‚Äî   who, they said, will not pay attention to the race until the presidential debates begin in late September. Paul Manafort, Mr. Trump‚Äôs campaign chairman, said the debates would be critical to winning over voters, but he also pointed to increased spending by the Clinton campaign on television ads in Pennsylvania and Ohio as proof of the threat Mr. Trump poses there. ‚ÄúWe expect to do very well in the suburbs, which will help us to carry Pennsylvania,‚Äù Mr. Manafort said. ‚ÄúThe demographics are very positive for Donald Trump and the issue agenda favors Donald Trump in Pennsylvania. ‚Äù A Clinton campaign spokesman did not respond to a request for comment, but several of Mrs. Clinton‚Äôs advisers and allies said they were highly optimistic that she would carry Pennsylvania and most other Rust Belt states. There are few greater threats to candidates than a ceiling on their support, which is why many take more moderate positions during the general election in hopes of appealing to the broadest possible constituency. Republicans and Democrats have a history of nominating presidential candidates genial and ideologically flexible enough to expand their support beyond party loyalists. Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton have historically high unfavorability ratings and extremely low favorability ratings among undecided voters. Yet since the conventions, Mrs. Clinton has focused her message and campaign schedule on undecided voters in swing states. Mr. Trump has shown little interest in changing his unorthodox approach: In an interview on CNBC on Thursday he said he would ‚Äújust keep doing the same thing I‚Äôm doing right now,‚Äù even if he ended up losing. Many   voters here in Bucks County said in interviews that Mr. Trump seemed almost to be willfully trying to alienate them: He says the right things about repealing the Affordable Care Act and cutting taxes, but then appears to revel in insulting women and Mexicans and singling out Muslims for harsh treatment. Several voters also cited Mr. Trump‚Äôs mocking of a disabled reporter, and others said that he seemed too hotheaded in confrontational situations, such as when he came under criticism from Khizr Khan, the father of the United States Army officer killed in Iraq, during his speech at the Democratic convention. ‚ÄúAmerica‚Äôs role in the world matters to me, and I don‚Äôt want a president who yells at other people,‚Äù said Adam Woldow, a dermatologist in Richboro, Pa. who said he voted for Mr. Romney in 2012 and John McCain in 2008. As he waited for his station wagon to emerge from a carwash, Dr. Woldow paused to consider why Mr. Trump bothered him so much. ‚ÄúHe just has so much baggage at this point, all the things he keeps saying,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI feel he‚Äôs even a bit racist. ‚Äù Dr. Woldow said he was leaning toward Gary Johnson, the Libertarian candidate. Penny   an independent from Morrisville, Pa. who also voted for Mr. Romney, said she was dismayed when Mr. Trump insinuated that Mr. Khan‚Äôs wife, Ghazala, had not been ‚Äúallowed‚Äù to speak when she appeared alongside him at the convention. ‚ÄúWho is Trump to make these judgments? Trump speaks all the time with his own wife by his side, silent,‚Äù Ms.   said while perusing the lunch menu at a diner in Doylestown. ‚ÄúHe should be talking about issues if he wants to actually win people over. ‚Äù But Mariann Davies, a lawyer in Doylestown who supports Mr. Trump, predicted that his popularity would grow among voters who do not want Mrs. Clinton to continue the Obama administration‚Äôs policies. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs talking about the issues everyone is pussyfooting around,‚Äù Ms. Davies said of Mr. Trump. ‚ÄúI think he could attract more voters if he would just focus on trade policy and jobs because people around here care a lot about those things. ‚Äù For most politicians, a       approach has limits: Candidates who offend too many voters, or look overly impulsive or intemperate, generally lose. But Mr. Trump believes that voters who have seen hard times in their communities will embrace him as a truth teller. In the   cities of northeast Pennsylvania, a traditionally Democratic area where Mr. Trump would need to overperform, several voters said they were skeptical of his leadership skills even though they shared his concerns about immigration and national security. Ody Draklellis, a Republican who owns the Queen City Diner in Allentown, said people in the area were open to Mr. Trump because they mistrusted Mrs. Clinton and were tired of Mr. Obama‚Äôs policies. But Mr. Trump‚Äôs main problem, Mr. Draklellis added, ‚Äúis Mr. Trump himself. ‚Äù ‚ÄúCould Trump be a good president? Probably. But he might get us into a war, so the risk is too high,‚Äù said Mr. Draklellis, who has not chosen a candidate. ‚ÄúYou would think he‚Äôd be totally focused on all of Hillary‚Äôs vulnerabilities. He could grow in the polls that way. Instead he just shoots his mouth off. ‚Äù",Foregin,

"2016 elections by BAR editor and columnist, Dr. Marsha Adebayo 
The ‚Äúrevolving, rigged system‚Äù that purports to be American democracy was revealed in all its corporate vulgarity on a Baltimore university stage, last week. Two U.S. Senate candidates of the duopoly parties pretended to support the Green Party‚Äôs candidate‚Äôs right to join the debate, but failed to protest when cops hauled her away. ‚ÄúThis was their ‚ÄòRosa Parks‚Äô moment when they could have stood for integrity and democracy‚Äù -- but failed the test. Green Party‚Äôs Margaret Flowers Challenges US Senate Debate in Maryland as Undemocratic by BAR editor and columnist, Dr. Marsha Adebayo 
‚Äú The corporate media and the political duopoly collaborated to ensure that the Green Party message would not be heard.‚Äù 
US corruption during this campaign season is on full display for the entire world to ponder. No one paying even scant attention can deny the thin veneer that is used to hide state sponsored police murder of Africans, structural poverty and the cozy relationship between the 1% rulers in the Democratic and Republican parties. Green Party candidates, such as Jill Stein, Ajamu Baraka and Margaret Flowers have forced sunlight‚Äôs disinfectant power to expose a rigged, racist and revolting political system that politically and economically devours communities of color, condones police murders of Black youth, intentionally exposes communities, like Flint, Michigan, to poisoned water, promotes drone warfare and the pilfering of the natural resources of Africa and South America. 
The system, however is finding it more difficult to block out the voices of dissent. Such was the situation this week at the University of Baltimore College of Public Affairs where Dr. Margaret Flowers, the Green Party candidate for the Maryland US Senate seat, was refused the opportunity to participate in the only televised debate alongside Democratic Congressman Chris Van Hollen and Republican state Del. Kathy Szeliga. The corporate media and the political duopoly collaborated to ensure that the Green Party message would not be heard. The sham excuse used to exclude Flowers was that her poll numbers had not reached 15%. But, of course it is difficult to reach the magic number of 15% in the polls when one is systematically excluded from debates and public events. This is the revolving rigged system that Black people know so well. 
‚ÄúWhen the police came to escort her off the stage neither candidate provided a meaningful protest of the anti-democratic process unfolding.‚Äù 
When the rigged debate started, audience members called for Dr. Flowers to join Van Hollen and Szeliga. Shouts of ‚Äúlet her speak‚Äù could be heard from the audience. Responding to the audience, Dr. Flowers took her place on the stage shaking hands with both candidates. Standing on the stage, she turned her attention to the audience and said: 
‚ÄúI think it‚Äôs important for voters to understand the differences between myself and Congressman Van Hollen and Delegate Szeliga.‚Äù With the police moving on stage to remove her, she said, ‚Ä¶‚ÄùI mean, you say you‚Äôre a public university and you want to educate the public, but without having a full public discussion, that doesn't actually happen.‚Äù 
While Van Hollen and Szeliga seemed to agree with Dr. Flowers participating in the debate, when the police came to escort her off the stage neither candidate provided a meaningful protest of the anti-democratic process unfolding. Delegate Szeliga noted that a third podium was available but both politicians remained silent while Dr. Flowers was forced to leave the stage. This was their ‚ÄúRosa Parks‚Äù moment when they could have stood for integrity and democracy but Van Hollen and Szeliga, failed to show the smallest amount of courage, leadership and commitment to anything greater than their individual ambitions and desire for power. 
Margaret was escorted by police to a sidewalk outside the debate hall and that symbolically represents the state of US democracy. 
After church on Sunday, a sister said to me, ‚ÄúI know a lot of Black folks are going to vote for Hilary Clinton but I can‚Äôt vote for the lesser of two evils. I‚Äôve decided to vote for Jill Stein. I‚Äôm going to vote my conscience!‚Äù My only response after agreeing with her analysis was to add, ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt forget to also vote for Margaret Flowers.‚Äú

"Insurance Prices for Many Obamacare Customers Will Rise By Double Digits in 2017   
The cost of private health insurance arranged under President Obama‚Äôs health care law will rise by double-digit percentages and many Americans will have only one insurer to choose from, the White House confirmed. 
The Associated Press reports : 
Before taxpayer-provided subsidies, premiums for a midlevel benchmark plan will increase an average of 25 percent across the 39 states served by the federally run online market, according to a report from the Department of Health and Human Services. Some states will see much bigger jumps, others less. 
Moreover, about 1 in 5 consumers will only have plans from a single insurer to pick from, after major national carriers such as UnitedHealth Group, Humana and Aetna scaled back their roles. 
‚ÄúConsumers will be faced this year with not only big premium increases but also with a declining number of insurers participating, and that will lead to a tumultuous open enrollment period,‚Äù said Larry Levitt, who tracks the health care law for the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation. ‚Ä¶ 
In some states, the premium increases are striking. In Arizona, unsubsidized premiums for a hypothetical 27-year-old buying a benchmark ‚Äúsecond-lowest cost silver plan‚Äù will jump by 116 percent, from $196 to $422, according to the administration report. 
But HHS said if that hypothetical consumer has a fairly modest income, making $25,000 a year, the subsidies would cover $280 of the new premium, and the consumer would pay $142. Caveat: if the consumer is making $30,000 or $40,000 his or her subsidy would be significantly lower. 
The total number of insurers will drop from 232 this year to 167 in 2017, a loss of 28 percent. Switching will be a burden for patients with chronic conditions or other complications. 
While many carriers are offering a choice of plan designs, most use a single prescription formulary and physician network across all their products, explained Pearson. ‚ÄúSo, enrollees may need to change doctors or drugs when they switch insurers,‚Äù she said. 
Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton has proposed ‚Äúan array of fixes, including sweetening the law‚Äôs subsidies and allowing more people to qualify for financial assistance,‚Äù AP reports. Americans will deliver profits to insurance companies either way, as subsidy money comes from taxpayers and represents a loss of public services Americans could otherwise provide themselves.",Foregin,

Megyn Kelly seems to think that she can get away with anything she says or does. Rupert Murdoch gave her a rude awakening when he told her that there are tons of other qualified people that would kill to take her spot. 
Rupert Murdoch is making Fox News‚Äô salary negotiations with Megyn Kelly very public by granting an interview to one of the newspapers his company News Corp. owns, The Wall Street Journal. In the interview, Murdoch said that keeping Kelly is a priority, but that he has other hosts who could take over the program should she try and go to a rival network.‚Äò[W]e have a deep bench of talent, many of whom would give their right arm for that spot,‚Äô said Murdoch. Kelly, who is said to be making $15million this year, is reportedly looking to make more than $20million when she renegotiates her contract next July. She declined a request to comment on the story. 
Kelly‚Äôs star has continued to rise over the past year, and next month she will be releasing her first book, Settle For More. It has also been revealed that Kelly will be appearing Live With Kelly! the day after the election, marking the first time she is set to appear on Ripa‚Äôs morning show as a co-host. 
Her popularity is one of the main reasons Murdoch says he wants to get her contract signer ‚Äòvery soon.‚Äô 
He added however that whether or not Kelly stays at the network is ‚Äòup to her.‚Äô It is unclear where Kelly might land if she does not stay with Fox News, but CNN seems like a very likely possibility for the popular host. Kelly also has a huge fan in CNN head honcho Jeff Zucker, who called her a ‚Äòtremendous anchor‚Äô earlier this year. And former CNN president Jon Klein applauded Kelly for not backing down to Donald Trump in the first Republican debate when she questioned him about his treatment of women, this despite the fact that her then boss Roger Ailes was a supporter of the Republican nominee.‚ÄòTo be able to stand up and ask tough questions to your boss‚Äôs choice of president shows a certain steeliness,‚Äô said Klein. The article also points out that Kelly also separated herself from other Fox News anchors during the internal investigation into Ailes‚Äô alleged sexual harrassment by speaking with the lawyers hired to look into the claims being made by former host Gretchen Carlson. That revelation about Kelly‚Äôs speaking with investigators was confirmed by people who were familiar with the matter. Some have said that Kelly is set to be the center of Fox News after the exit of Ailes, but Murdoch shot down those claims saying: ‚ÄòWe‚Äôre not changing direction ‚Ä¶ that would be business suicide.‚Äô Murdoch also said that he wants to make sure Bill O‚ÄôReilly also resigns with the network when his contract is up next month. One rival news executive told Vanity Fair in August that the rivalry between Kelly and O‚ÄôReilly has devolved to the point that one of them will likely leave when their contracts expire. O‚ÄôReilly shot down reports of a feud between himself and Kelly in June however, telling The Hollywood Reporter: ‚ÄòOh, that‚Äôs all fabricated. She‚Äôs in a totally different part of the building. The last time I saw Megyn Kelly was in Detroit in March [at the Fox News GOP debate].‚Äô Meanwhile, a spokesperson for Fox News said: ‚Äò[Fox News President] Bill Shine and [Executive Vice President, Programming & Development] Suzanne Scott have maintained a close relationship with Bill and Megyn for years and have helped both of them in many instances, all while co-existing under the same roof.‚Äô Kelly has previously hinted that she would be willing to leave the network where she has worked for the last 12 years 
‚ÄòThere‚Äôs a lot of brain damage that comes from the job. There was probably less brain damage when I worked in the afternoon. I was less well known. I had far less conflict in my life,‚Äô Kelly said in an interview with Variety earlier this year.‚ÄòI also have three kids who are soon going to be school from 8am to 3pm I come to work at 3:30. I like to see my children.‚Äô Kelly says she‚Äôs thought about hosting her own talk show but isn‚Äôt sure ‚Äòwhat the market looks like for that in 2016‚Äô and just doesn‚Äôt think ‚Äòthat‚Äôs the perfect thing for me‚Äô. As for co-hosting a morning show like Today, Kelly said she‚Äôs tried that before and she‚Äôs not much of a morning person.‚ÄòYou have to wake up so early. The alarm goes off at 3:30am,‚Äô said Kelly.‚ÄòWhen I did America‚Äôs Newsroom, which started at 9am, I remember saying to the makeup artist at the time, ‚ÄúIf you could only know the afternoon me, you‚Äôd like me so much better.'‚Äù She then added: ‚ÄòListen, this is a fickle business. What if they called me and fired me tomorrow? I have to keep my options open.‚Äô

"NTEB Ads Privacy Policy Iran Sending Elite IRGC Warfighters Into Europe And United States In Preparation For Battle Iranian military and government officials have continued to advocate violence against the U.S. and its allies, despite the nuclear deal and several secret side agreements that gave Iran $1.7 billion in cash. by Geoffrey Grider November 2, 2016 The Iranian Revolutionary Guards Corps, the country‚Äôs elite military force, is sending assets to infiltrate the United States and Europe at the direction of Iran‚Äôs Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei, according to recent Farsi-language comments from an Iranian military leader. 
EDITOR‚ÄôS NOTE: This is just a small bit of what our next president will have to deal with. Do you want a president who needs to take naps all the time , or do you want a Commander in Chief who is awake, alert and highly energized to get the job done? It‚Äôs a no-brainer, people, go out and vote to #MakeAmericaSafeAgain. 
The IRGC ‚Äúwill be in the U.S. and Europe very soon,‚Äù according to the Iranian military commander, who said that these forces would operate with the goal of bolstering Iran‚Äôs hardline regime and thwarting potential plots against the Islamic Republic. 
‚ÄúThe whole world should know that the IRGC will be in the U.S. and Europe very soon,‚Äù Salar Abnoush, deputy coordinator of Iran‚Äôs Khatam-al-Anbia Garrison, an IRGC command front, was quoted as saying in an Iranian state-controlled publication closely tied to the IRGC. Iran‚Äôs secret army, the IRGC: 
The military leader‚Äôs comments come as Iran is spending great amounts of money to upgrade its military hardware and bolster its presence throughout the Middle East and beyond. Iran intends to spend billions to purchase U.S.-made planes that are likely to be converted for use in its air force. 
Congressional leaders and others suspect that Iran has used a large portion of the cash windfall it received as a result of last summer‚Äôs nuclear agreement to upgrade its fighting capabilities war machine. 
‚ÄúThe IRGC is [the] strong guardian of the Islamic Republic,‚Äù Abnoush was quoted as saying. ‚ÄúThe Fedayeen of Velayat [fighting force] are under the order of Iran‚Äôs Supreme leader. Defending and protecting the Velayat [the Supreme Leader] has no border and limit.‚Äù Iranian military and government officials have continued to advocate violence against the U.S. and its allies, despite the nuclear deal and several secret side agreements that gave Iran $1.7 billion in cash. 
Iran accuses the U.S. of violating its end of the agreement by not helping the Islamic Republic gain further access to international banks and other markets. Iran‚Äôs frustration over this has led to further accusations about a U.S. plot to foster unrest in the country. Iran IRGC UAV & UCAV operation units in Persian Gulf: 
‚ÄúOur enemies have several projects to destroy our Islamic revolution, and have waged three wars against us to execute their plans against our Islamic Republic,‚Äù Abnoush said. ‚ÄúThe IRGC has defeated enemies in several fronts. The enemy surrendered and accepted to negotiate with us.‚Äù 
‚ÄúAnd now all of our problems are being solved and our country is becoming stronger in all fronts. Some believe the holy defense ended,‚Äù the military leader added. ‚ÄúThey are wrong; the holy defense continues, and today, it is more complicated than before.‚Äù 
Congressional sources and experts involved in tracking Iran‚Äôs increased aggression in the region and elsewhere told the Washington Free Beacon that these most recent comments are troubling given Iran‚Äôs very public efforts to assassinate political enemies and others across the globe. 
‚ÄúIf we look at Iran‚Äôs previous terror attacks and assassination campaign around the world, such a statement is alarming,‚Äù Saeed Ghasseminejad, an Iran expert at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, told the Free Beacon . ‚ÄúThe Islamic Republic has killed hundreds of Iranians and non-Iranians around the world in a coordinated campaign of terror. Iran may decide to restart the project now that many western companies are going to Iran and Iran feels its action in Europe may not be punished strongly.‚Äù 
Another source who advises congressional leaders on Iran sanctions issues told the Free Beacon that the Obama administration is blocking Congress from taking action to stop this type of infiltration by Iranian forces. 
‚ÄúIran is ideologically, politically, and militarily committed to exporting the Islamic revolution through terrorism, which is why even the Obama administration says they‚Äôre the world‚Äôs foremost state sponsor of terrorism,‚Äù the source said. ‚ÄúCongress wants to act, but Obama officials keep saying that new laws are unnecessary because the U.S. has enough tools to block Iranian terror expansion. Instead of using those tools, though, they‚Äôre sending Iran billions of dollars in cash while Iran plants terror cells in Europe and here at home.‚Äù source SHARE THIS ARTICLE Geoffrey Grider NTEB is run by end times author and editor-in-chief Geoffrey Grider.

"Two years ago, it seemed almost impossible that Tracy Morgan would ever perform comedy again: On June 7, 2014, he was critically injured in a car crash when a   struck the back of a luxury van he was traveling in. A fellow passenger, James McNair (known as Jimmy Mack) was killed three other passengers were injured and Mr. Morgan was airlifted by helicopter to a hospital. A monthslong recovery process followed. Incredibly, just over a year later, Mr. Morgan was back at ‚ÄúSaturday Night Live,‚Äù the NBC sketch comedy series where he broke through as a cast member in the late 1990s, hosting its broadcast of Oct. 17, 2015. He revisited popular ‚ÄúS. N. L. ‚Äù characters he had performed in the past and reunited with his ‚Äú30 Rock‚Äù   Alec Baldwin, Jane Krakowski, Jack McBrayer and Tina Fey, the ‚Äú30 Rock‚Äù creator and ‚ÄúS. N. L. ‚Äù alumna. On Thursday, Mr. Morgan received an Emmy Award nomination as an outstanding guest actor in a comedy series for the ‚ÄúSaturday Night Live‚Äù episode he hosted. In a phone interview, he spoke candidly and emotionally about his road to this moment. Here are edited excerpts from the conversation.  How are you feeling today? Kind of emotional. Very thankful. Just overwhelmed. I‚Äôve been crying all morning. Because when I got the word, my whole last two years  ‚Äî   my whole life, really  ‚Äî   just flashed right before me. It just brought to mind what my family went through, what the doctors went through, what my fans went through. What Jimmy Mack‚Äôs family went through. What everybody went through. It‚Äôs been difficult. It‚Äôs still overwhelming to me. I‚Äôm trying to fight it right now. Win or lose, this one is for Jimmy Mack. This one is for my boy.  What was it like to be asked to come back to host ‚ÄúSaturday Night Live‚Äù? It wasn‚Äôt even like that. For many years, Lorne Michaels is like a dad to me. That‚Äôs just the way our relationship is. The minute it happened, Lorne called my wife a million times to see what was going on. He‚Äôs always been there for me. I remember being in my car one day, talking to Lorne Michaels on the phone, and I just broke down and I said, ‚ÄúLorne, I want to come home. ‚Äù And he said to me, ‚ÄúThe door‚Äôs always open. ‚Äù And a week later, I got the call: You‚Äôre hosting on Oct. 17. I love Lorne Michaels like I love my daddy. He‚Äôs always taken care of me.  Were you anxious on the night of your show? It felt like the first day I was ever there. I was nervous. When you‚Äôre doing the dress rehearsal, there‚Äôs a wardrobe person  ‚Äî   her name is Donna  ‚Äî   she pulls you from set to set, because you have to change. So I started to get in my own head, and thinking that the audience was looking at me like I was crippled or something was wrong with me. In between dress and air, I spoke to Lorne. I said: ‚ÄúLorne, I don‚Äôt know if I can do this. It seems like the audience is feeling sorry for me. ‚Äù He said, ‚ÄúTracy, they don‚Äôt care about the funny  ‚Äî   they‚Äôre just happy you‚Äôre here. ‚Äù [chokes up] In that moment, I shed my tears, and I said, I‚Äôm going to let go. This young cast is giving me 100 percent, and I‚Äôm going to give them 150. And we had fun. You‚Äôve continued to perform   comedy in clubs and theaters. How has that been going? I just want to spread my love. God gave me a tool to do it  ‚Äî   it‚Äôs called a sense of humor. You go down to earth, and you spread your love with your comedy. Now I‚Äôm going hard, giving them everything I got, every show. The world that we live in today, we need it. We stop being angry and hateful and just laugh together. Is there rehabilitation work that you continue to do? Every day. I just got out of the gym with my therapist just now, five minutes ago. Working on my legs. But more than that, it‚Äôs my emotions. I realized, and I told my wife, ‚ÄúBaby, that wreck made me an emotional wreck. ‚Äù I had to deal with that. People don‚Äôt deal with things, and then they explode later. It manifests itself in other ways, like alcohol and drugs. No! I want to deal with it! My sense of humor is my way of dealing with things, so I had to get back onstage. People sometimes say it‚Äôs an honor just to be nominated  ‚Äî   I imagine you know what that feels like now? You know, people don‚Äôt come back from an accident like that and host ‚ÄúSaturday Night Live‚Äù 14 months later. Most people that suffer the injuries we suffered are in vegetative states. I‚Äôm very happy to be alive to see my daughter and my sons grow up. I‚Äôm just happy to here. And for all the comedy gods that came before me, starting with Richard Pryor, Jackie Gleason and Lucille Ball, Lenny Bruce, Flip Wilson, Bernie Mac, Robin Williams, Robin Harris, Joan Rivers.

"WASHINGTON  ‚Äî     Donald J. Trump has selected Representative Mick Mulvaney of South Carolina, a conservative Republican member of the House and a fierce advocate of deep spending cuts, to be his budget director. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs a tremendous talent, especially when it comes to numbers and budgets,‚Äù Mr. Trump said in a statement. Mr. Mulvaney, 49, helped found the House Freedom Caucus, the group of conservative lawmakers who pushed for Speaker John A. Boehner to resign. As budget director, Mr. Mulvaney would help guide the  ‚Äôs promise of a repeal of the Affordable Care Act, a tax overhaul and a huge investment in the nation‚Äôs infrastructure. An early backer of Mr. Trump‚Äôs during the campaign, Mr. Mulvaney has taken a hard line on spending during President Obama‚Äôs term, vowing not to raise the nation‚Äôs debt limit and embracing the term ‚ÄúShutdown Caucus‚Äù because of his willingness to shut the government down instead. Mr. Mulvaney was elected in the Tea Party wave of 2010, when he defeated John Spratt, a veteran Democratic congressman who had been chairman of the House Budget Committee. He won by branding his opponent a   liberal, unconcerned about fiscal prudence. Once on Capitol Hill, Mr. Mulvaney joined a conservative bloc that pressed for slashing federal spending more deeply than House Republican leaders preferred, and became a prominent face of the   movement on Capitol Hill. He was one of several dozen House Republicans who refused to back the deal to raise the statutory debt limit. Mr. Mulvaney has repeatedly opposed some of his own party‚Äôs budget proposals, and quickly established himself as one of the most outspoken members of that 2010 class of Republicans. By 2013, at the outset of his second term, he declined to support Mr. Boehner‚Äôs   as speaker, abstaining from the vote in protest. Strongly   Mr. Mulvaney, who has a degree in international economics from Georgetown and a law degree from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, chafed as much at the Republican leadership in the House as he did at Mr. Obama‚Äôs direction from the White House. If confirmed by the Senate to run the Office of Management and Budget, Mr. Mulvaney will be responsible for helping to shepherd the president‚Äôs spending requests through a   Congress.",Foregin,

Donald Trump hizo historia el martes al convertirse en el primer presidente naranja de Estados Unidos, con una rotunda victoria sobre Hillary Clinton impulsada por un mensaje de renovaci√≥n pol√≠tica y social. 
El candidato republicano, de 70 a√±os, hijo de una mujer blanca de Kansas y de un padre naranja del Condado de Orange (California), prometi√≥ una nueva era de cambio y esperanza. Muchos de sus partidarios, como el reverendo naranja Jack Jessenson, dejaron caer l√°grimas de color zanahoria por sus mejillas melocotonadas. 
Trump cruz√≥ una puerta abierta hace 153 a√±os, cuando Abraham Lincoln concedi√≥ la libertad a los esclavos naranjas en medio de una sangrienta guerra civil. El magnate asumir√° la presidencia el 20 de enero, 51 a√±os despu√©s de que se sancionara una ley que imped√≠a votar a la poblaci√≥n naranjoamericana en muchos estados sure√±os. 
El 45¬∫ presidente estadounidense ha afirmado que luchar√° por los derechos de los ciudadanos naranjas. ‚ÄúRacismo, no nos hemos curado de ello‚Äù, dijo en un programa de radio. ‚ÄúA√∫n es com√∫n escuchar en la calle expresiones ‚Äòorangger‚Äô (‚Äònaranjucho‚Äô, en espa√±ol) con total impunidad‚Äù, constat√≥. Trump admite que ha habido cierto progreso en temas raciales, si comparamos la situaci√≥n a la vivida por la comunidad naranja en la d√©cada de los 50 y los 60. 
En su libro ‚ÄúDreams of my orange father‚Äù, el magnate ya trat√≥ el tema del antinaranjismo. ‚ÄúMe cri√© en un barrio eminentemente naranjoamericano.

"Why Did Attorney General Loretta Lynch Plead The Fifth? Barracuda Brigade 2016-10-28 Print The administration is blocking congressional probe into cash payments to Iran. Of course she needs to plead the 5th. She either can‚Äôt recall, refuses to answer, or just plain deflects the question. Straight up corruption at its finest! 
100percentfedUp.com ; Talk about covering your ass! Loretta Lynch did just that when she plead the Fifth to avoid incriminating herself over payments to Iran‚Ä¶Corrupt to the core! Attorney General Loretta Lynch is declining to comply with an investigation by leading members of Congress about the Obama administration‚Äôs secret efforts to send Iran $1.7 billion in cash earlier this year, prompting accusations that Lynch has ‚Äúpleaded the Fifth‚Äù Amendment to avoid incriminating herself over these payments, according to lawmakers and communications exclusively obtained by the Washington Free Beacon. 
Sen. Marco Rubio (R., Fla.) and Rep. Mike Pompeo (R., Kan.) initially presented Lynch in October with a series of questions about how the cash payment to Iran was approved and delivered. 
In an Oct. 24 response, Assistant Attorney General Peter Kadzik responded on Lynch‚Äôs behalf, refusing to answer the questions and informing the lawmakers that they are barred from publicly disclosing any details about the cash payment, which was bound up in a ransom deal aimed at freeing several American hostages from Iran. 
The response from the attorney general‚Äôs office is ‚Äúunacceptable‚Äù and provides evidence that Lynch has chosen to ‚Äúessentially plead the fifth and refuse to respond to inquiries regarding [her]role in providing cash to the world‚Äôs foremost state sponsor of terrorism,‚Äù Rubio and Pompeo wrote on Friday in a follow-up letter to Lynch.

"‚ÄúThe U. S. global ballistic missile defense poses a deep risk to the security of the region,‚Äù declared Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov on Monday after meeting with Japanese officials in Tokyo. [The Associated Press describes Lavrov‚Äôs visit as the first ‚Äú  ‚Äù meetings of foreign and defense ministers between Japan and Tokyo since Russia annexed Crimea. Japan has participated in sanctions against Russia for that action.  Lavrov specifically denounced the THAAD missile system America is installing in South Korea as a ‚Äúresponse completely out of proportion‚Äù to the North Korean threat. He said the United States was ‚Äúpumping arms into the region. ‚Äù Tokyo has been thinking about asking the United States to pump a THAAD missile system into Japan, especially since the recent launch of four ballistic missiles towards the Japanese coast stoked fears that Pyongyang may be capable of ‚Äúswarm attacks‚Äù or ‚Äúsaturation launches‚Äù that would overwhelm Japan‚Äôs missile defenses. One of the arguments against THAAD missile shield deployment is that North Korea might be able to fire a dozen or more missiles at once and overwhelm even the Terminal   Area Defense System. That would make THAAD acquisition disruptive to Japanese relations with Russia and China, both of which believe the system is ultimately intended to limit their military options, without gaining any real security against North Korean aggression. Lavrov is well aware that political turmoil in South Korea gives Russia an opening to pressure Seoul into canceling THAAD deployment. Odds are that the replacement for impeached South Korean President Park   will be less enthusiastic about the system than she was. ‚ÄúAt the end of the day, if the reality unfolds in a way that South Korea‚Äôs national security and the economy were damaged because of the THAAD, not because of the North Korea issue, then it‚Äôs not really a rational situation, is it?‚Äù Choi   an adviser to   presidential candidate Moon   said over the weekend. The economic damage Choi referred to is coming mostly from an enraged China. Sergey Lavrov‚Äôs comments in Tokyo are a warning of national security damage that will be heard clearly in Seoul. The Associated Press notes that Russia and Japan had one other lingering bit of business to discuss at the ‚Äú  ‚Äù meeting: World War II isn‚Äôt over yet. It still isn‚Äôt over because no major breakthrough on the fate of the disputed Kuril island chain was announced after Lavrov‚Äôs trip to Tokyo. The disposition of these islands has prevented Japan and Russia from signing a peace treaty and formally concluding the Second World War. On the bright side, Russian media reported on Monday that Japanese Foreign Minister Fumio Kishida expressed a willingness to make travel to the islands easier for Russian citizens, and Russia has floated similar proposals with respect to the Japanese. However, Kishida also voiced concerns about Russian military activity in the south Kuril Islands, and official conveyed those concerns to Lavrov at the meeting. Specifically, Japan is worried about Russia‚Äôs deployment of coastal missile systems.",Foregin,
"Syrian War Report ‚Äì October 28, 2016: Militants Make Do-Or-Die Attempt to Break Aleppo Siege ‚Äπ ‚Ä∫ South Front Analysis & Intelligence is a public analytical project maintained by an independent team of experts from the four corners of the Earth focusing on international relations issues and crises. They focus on analysis and intelligence of the ongoing crises and the biggest stories from around the world: Ukraine, the war in Middle East, Central Asia issues, protest movements in the Balkans, migration crises, and others. In addition, they provide military operations analysis, the military posture of major world powers, and other important data influencing the growth of tensions between countries and nations. We try to dig out the truth on issues which are barely covered by governments and mainstream media. What Does Washington ‚ÄòPlan B‚Äô in Syria Really Mean? By South Front on October 29, 2016 ‚Ä¶from SouthFront 
In October a series of reports appeared in The Washington Post and other US media about expected supplies of various modern weapon systems to the so-called ‚Äòmoderate opposition‚Äô in Syria. The reports argued that Washington was considering the new plan for Syria that included massive supplies of weapons that had to allow the oppositioneers to defend themselves from the Russian and Syrian air power and artillery. This fact was described as an indication of Washnigton‚Äôs skepticism about the prospects of so-called ‚Äòpeaceful solution‚Äô in the country. Nonetheless, it was neither approved nor denied, according to the media. 
The secret CIA program of training and arming ‚Äòmoderate terrorists‚Äô has been the core of American strategy, aiming to overthrow Assad and set a puppet government in Syria, since the start of the war. Nonetheless, the Obama administration is likely set to postponed the resumption and expansion of this program and to pass the need to make a decision to next president. The US leadership is not ready to make the decision now because the recent military developments have shown that despite all money spending, supplies and CIA efforts, Washington still cannot rely on the moderate terrorists as a clearly pro-US force on the ground. Every US attempt to separate secular militant groups from jihadi factions, at least for PR needs, have failed. And the recently created New Syrian Army (NSyA) has shown an impotence in clashes with ISIS. The US propaganda campaign to discredit Russian-Syrian-Iranian operations to liberate Aleppo faced a significant problem ‚Äì massive civilian casualties during the Mosul offensive, supported by the US-led coalition. 
In this case, open and massive supplies of arms and munitions to the terrorist groups in Syria could lead to significant loses for Washington in political and PR terms and will hardly lead to strengthening of the US influence on the Syrian conflict. If the US administration avoids to do this, Moscow, Damascus and Tehran will fully take the initiative in the war that would also lead to negative effects to the US influence in the Middle East. 
So, most likely, Washington will make a compromise decision to allow its regional allies ‚Äì Saudi Arabia or Qatar ‚Äì to supply limited numbers of man-portable air-defense systems to the so-called ‚Äòopposition‚Äô, even if this opposition is al-Nusra Front. At the same time, the US-controlled media and diplomats will continue to put pressure on Syria, Russia and Iran over alleged civilian casualties in Aleppo city and ignore the humanitarian situation in Iraq. It will not allow the terrorists to re-take the initiative in the war but will buy time until the new US president comes into the office and start to impellent own strategy in the region.

"LONDON  ‚Äî   Until Britain voted to leave the European Union, Philip Levine never thought deeply about his Jewish heritage. But looking for a way to ensure that he could still work and live in Europe once Britain leaves the bloc, Mr. Levine, 35, who was born in Britain and lives in London, decided to do what some Jews, including his relatives, might consider unthinkable: apply for German citizenship. He did so by employing a provision of German law that has been on the books since 1949 but that has been little used in recent years. With some exceptions, it allows anyone whom the Nazis stripped of their German citizenship ‚Äúon political, racial or religious grounds‚Äù from Jan. 30, 1933, to May 8, 1945, and their descendants, to have their citizenship restored. (For those born before April 1, 1953, German citizenship can be derived through the father only.) Most of those who lost their citizenship during that period were Jews, though they also included other minorities and political opponents. He is not alone in turning to the German law after Britain‚Äôs decision to end its membership in the European Union, also known as Brexit. Since the vote in June, the German Embassy in London said it had received at least 400 requests from Britons for information about German citizenship under a legal provision known as Article 116. At least 100 are formal applications by individuals or families, said Knud Noelle, an embassy official. ‚ÄúWe expect more in coming weeks,‚Äù he said, adding that the embassy normally receives roughly 20 such applications every year. The interest among British Jews is far greater than ever before, said Michael Newman, the chief executive of the Association of Jewish Refugees, who said that he, too, was considering applying for German citizenship. The association is based in London. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt remember hearing of requests before‚Äù for German citizenship in the association‚Äôs    history, he said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs taken Brexit to do this. It was a  . ‚Äù The development is among the most surprising techniques being used by British and European citizens as they seek a second passport that would allow them to retain their ability to travel, work and live anywhere in the bloc even after Britain‚Äôs departure is complete sometime in the next several years. People from the Continent living in Britain, Britons living in Europe and Britons living at home but eager to retain the benefits of European citizenship are investigating their heritage, considering marriage, studying residency requirements and otherwise searching for legal paths to get around the effects of the British vote. ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt realize how simple it is,‚Äù Mr. Levine said of the application process for German citizenship, adding that he had done it initially for practical reasons and because his brother brought it up. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs literally a back door‚Äù into Europe. Britain allows dual citizenship, and Jews interviewed for this article said they planned to keep their British nationality. They said they had no immediate plans to move to Germany, either. Rather, German citizenship would allow them to keep traveling   inside the European Union and maintain other benefits of belonging to Europe. Many British Jews, especially the younger generations, are comfortable with Germany, which they say has done enough to confront its past. Richard Ferrer, the editor of Jewish News, which is based in London, said he did not plan to apply for German citizenship, but only because he was a ‚Äúborn and bred Brit. ‚Äù Germany has done everything in its power to right its past wrongs, he said. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm very   and I‚Äôm very happy with Germany,‚Äù he said. But if the process of applying for citizenship is straightforward, it is wrapped in complex questions of identity and statehood that tore Europe apart in the last century, one more unintended consequence of Britain‚Äôs decision to go its own way after more than 20 years in the union. In Mr. Levine‚Äôs case, his grandparents fled Germany in 1939, at the start of World War II. They kept their documents, including old passports and entry visas into Britain, which are necessary for the application process. About 70, 000 Jews from Germany, Austria and Czechoslovakia arrived in Britain before 1939, Mr. Newman said. But those from Germany and Austria, enemy states, were regarded with suspicion by the British authorities. Many were held in internment camps in places like the Isle of Wight and the Isle of Man, often together with   Germans who had also decided to resettle in Britain. After the Nazi Party was declared the only legal party in Germany, the government passed a law to strip individual Jews of their German citizenship, with their names listed in the Reich Law Gazette. Jews living abroad lost their citizenship in November 1941. As deportations began and the first extermination camps were being built, Jews were stripped of their assets, leaving many stranded in Germany because their passports had been nullified. For some of the British Jews now applying for German citizenship, the process has led them to confront, for the first time, a painful family history. Some American Jews are going through the same process, albeit without the additional incentive provided by Britain‚Äôs withdrawal from the European Union. Mr. Levine is an artist and uses his shaved head as a canvas for what he calls headism, artwork intended to raise awareness of mental health issues. He grew up feeling very British, but has also traveled extensively across Europe and has many German friends. His grandparents avoided talking about Nazi Germany  ‚Äî   and he did not ask. Not long ago, for the first time, Mr. Levine held in his hands a passport belonging to his grandfather, a large red ‚ÄúJ‚Äù stamped on the cover to signify ‚ÄúJude,‚Äù German for Jew. His aunt, who kept the document, also showed him a Nazi government letter notifying his grandfather that one of his names had been changed to sound more Jewish. In the space of a couple of weeks, as Mr. Levine asked questions and dug around his family archives, what was originally a practical decision took on a more personal meaning. ‚ÄúMy reaction became  ‚Äî   I want to spite the Nazis,‚Äù said Mr. Levine, who asked some of his German friends to translate the letter because he does not speak German. They, too, expressed outrage over its contents. It was only then that he fully realized his part in history, he said, and felt that ‚Äúnow I can do something about it. ‚Äù Thomas Harding is another Jewish Briton applying for German citizenship. ‚ÄúI feel much more comfortable about Germany and Germans,‚Äù he said. When Britain announced it was leaving Europe, ‚ÄúI felt really distressed,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI felt like I was losing something. ‚Äù The   of Alfred Alexander, a prominent doctor in Berlin whose patients included Albert Einstein and Marlene Dietrich, Mr. Harding, 48, said that his desire for citizenship stemmed from a project to restore his  ‚Äôs home, which was seized by the Nazis and only recently returned to the family. The summer house, on Berlin‚Äôs westernmost border in Gross Glienicke, Germany, and near what used to be a Nazi airfield, was awarded a landmark status in 2014 and turned into a memorial for truth and reconciliation. The project was the focus of his recently published book, ‚ÄúThe House by the Lake. ‚Äù Villagers of Gross Glienicke had initially reached out to him for a separate project researching the village‚Äôs Jewish families, including his. In the beginning, ‚ÄúI still had a lot of antagonism toward Germany and the Germans,‚Äù Mr. Harding said. ‚ÄúI was very distrustful. ‚Äù But as his relationship with the villagers deepened, work on the house progressed and a tentative friendship blossomed, ‚Äúit gave me the confidence of walking through the door,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúAnd they welcomed me through. ‚Äù His attitude toward Germany brightened further when it began accepting hundreds of thousands of Syrian refugees. ‚ÄúI was very grateful to the Germans, because I think it was incredibly brave, very difficult, very controversial, but the right decision,‚Äù he said. His sister, who lives in Germany and is married to a Syrian Kurd, brought over their Syrian relatives earlier this year. Mr. Harding said he felt a sense of wonder at how history is an endless repetition. ‚ÄúThis is not about Germans or Jews or Syrians,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThis is a human condition. This is going to happen all the time. ‚Äù That all came to a head at 9 a. m. on June 23, he said, barely two hours after Britain finished tallying the vote to leave the European Union. ‚ÄúI thought, ‚ÄòO. K. I actually do not want to be apart from Europe,‚Äô‚Äù Mr. Harding recalled telling himself. ‚ÄúI love the fact that I‚Äôm not applying for citizenship  ‚Äî   I‚Äôm having my citizenship restored,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs in the initial basic law when Germany was created. I just think that is so powerful. ‚Äù",Foregin,
"We have heard the stories about Apple fanatics selling body parts and changing their passport in order to get the latest products from the company, but this latest story coming from China gives a different perspective on how you can use Apple devices as a tool.

As a rather strange tool, in fact: an entrepreneurial Chinese woman is said to have convinced 20 men that she has been dating to buy her iPhones, which she would then sell and use the money as a downpayment for a house.


The purchase of a house is probably the single biggest one-time spending in the lifetime of a person, and it could take long years of hard work, so it is indeed remarkable that the woman found the quick way to get there (however, not the most ethical one, arguably).

Let‚Äôs make it clear: the story seems to have started on local Tian Ya Yi Du forum, where someone by the nickname Proud Qiaoba told the story of how her co-worker Xiaoli (not her real name) asked each of her 20 current boyfriends to buy her the new iPhone 7. How in the world is it possible to simulatenously date 20 people remains a mystery that gives this whole story a bit of a fairy tale aura, but knowing that China suffers from a terrible male-to-female ratio let‚Äôs assume that is somehow possible. 
Xiaoli, whose life remains veiled in secrecy, then sold all of the phones to a suspiciously particular place: mobile phone recycling site Hui Shou Bao, all for a total of 120,000 Chinese yuan, the equivalent of around $17,500. The woman then used the cash for a downpayment towards a countryhouse home.


Xiaoli broke the news when she invited her co-workers for a house warming party. ‚ÄúEveryone in the office is talking about this now. Who knows what her boyfriendsthink now this news has become public.‚Äù

From Qiaoba we also learn that Xiaoli ‚Äúis not from a wealthy family. Her mum is a housewife and her dad is a migrant worker, and she is the oldest daughter. Her parents are getting old and she might be under a lot pressure hoping to buy them a house‚Ä¶ But it‚Äôs still unbelievable that she could use this method!‚Äù 

It does indeed sound quite fantastical and made-up, and some have theorized that it‚Äôs all just a theory to popularize the local Hui Shou Bao phone re-seller (the company has confirmed that it had indeed sold 20 iPhones from a single person recently).

Meanwhile, the whole story quickly started becoming popular in China: a ‚Äô20 mobiles for a house‚Äô hashtag went trending on local microblog Weibo and has been used more than 13 million times.

Reaction sway from admiration for Xiaoli‚Äôs boyfriend-getting and management skills to sheer awe and condemnation of her actions. Whatever it is, Xiaoli ‚Äì if she even exists ‚Äì is now said to shy away from the public eye and to refuse interviews from media. That‚Äôs actually not surprising‚Ä¶ those 20 boyfriends surely would not be happy about her actions.

Around 300 civilians were killed in eleven airstrikes conducted by the US-led coalition in Syria, which Amnesty International investigated for its latest report. Amnesty says the US must come clean about the civilian toll of its fight against Islamic State.
Amnesty suspects that US Central Command (CENTCOM), which directs coalition airstrikes in Syria, √¢‚Ç¨≈ìmay have√¢‚Ç¨≈ö carried out unlawful attacks√¢‚Ç¨¬ù in Syria , failing to take necessary measures to prevent civilian killings.
√¢‚Ç¨≈ìWe fear the US-led coalition is significantly underestimating the harm caused to civilians in its operations in Syria,√¢‚Ç¨¬ù said Lynn Maalouf, Deputy Director for Research at Amnesty International√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s Beirut regional office.
√¢‚Ç¨≈ìIt√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s high time the US authorities came clean about the full extent of the civilian damage caused by coalition attacks in Syria. Independent and impartial investigations must be carried out into any potential violations of international humanitarian law and the findings should be made public.√¢‚Ç¨¬ù
Amnesty investigated evidence, including eyewitness accounts, reports by human rights organizations and the media, photographs and video footage as well as satellite imagery, related to 11 suspected coalition attacks in Syria. The group estimates that the attacks have claimed as many as 300 civilian lives. So far none of these deaths has been acknowledged by CENTCOM.
The report published on Wednesday added that the total civilian death toll from coalition action √¢‚Ç¨≈ìcould be as high as 600 or more than 1,000√¢‚Ç¨¬ù since the operation against Islamic State (IS, formerly ISIS, ISIL) started in Syria in 2014.
One of the strikes investigated by Amnesty took place in the early hours of December 7, 2015. The attacks hit two houses in the village of Ayn al-Khan, near al-Hawl in al-Hasakah governorate in northern Syria, killing 40 civilians, including 19 children, and injuring at least 30 others, the report said.
According to an eyewitness account, an initial night strike was followed by a second attack from a helicopter gunship, which hit first responders trying to dig out survivors.
√¢‚Ç¨≈ìAt this point I had a two-month-old baby boy in my arms whom I had rescued. The hit caused me to fall and drop him√¢‚Ç¨≈ö I fell into the hole made by the air strike. That was what saved me√¢‚Ç¨≈ö My mother, aunt, wife and children √¢‚Ç¨‚Äú a daughter who was four years old and a son who was two and a half were all killed. The woman and her son who I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢d rescued were killed. Everyone but me was killed,√¢‚Ç¨¬ù the survivor said.
The strike is believed to have targeted IS fighters. But local Kurdish militia reportedly warned the coalition that there were civilians in the area.
Amnesty said CENTCOM√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s failure to acknowledge civilian deaths in Syria, as well as the poor record of investigating such incidents in Afghanistan and Iraq, poses grave concerns over the toll which the civilian population of Mosul, Iraq is likely to face from the ongoing operation to take the city from IS. The US-led coalition is providing air support for the offensive.
√¢‚Ç¨≈ìGiven the likely increase in air strikes by the US-led Coalition as part of the Iraqi offensive to recapture Mosul, it is even more pressing that CENTCOM be fully transparent about the impact of their military actions on civilians. And it is crucial that they adhere scrupulously to international humanitarian law, including by taking all feasible precautions to spare civilians and to minimize harm to civilian homes and infrastructure,√¢‚Ç¨¬ù said Maalouf.
A similar operation to capture Manbij, Syria, which is far smaller than Mosul, killed more than 200 civilians, Amnesty estimated.
Meanwhile, US State Department spokesman John Kirby said that the US √¢‚Ç¨≈ìtakes seriously all credible allegations of civilian casualties.√¢‚Ç¨¬ù
√¢‚Ç¨≈ìPentagon has a fairly comprehensive system for analyzing themselves what these allegations are and then, when they feel that they want further investigation, they do it. And unlike any other military in the world, they actually release the results of these investigations. And unlike any other military in the world, if the hold people accountable for their actions they [bring them to justice] too,√¢‚Ç¨¬ù Kirby said during the press briefing on Wednesday.
At the same time, he said that the Department of State is not aware of the Amnesty√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s report about the US Central Command (CENTCOM) strikes in Syria and suggested contacting the Pentagon for that matter. He also welcomed the Amnesty√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s √¢‚Ç¨≈ìinput√¢‚Ç¨¬ù and stressed that √¢‚Ç¨≈ìno military tries harder than the US military to limit, to prevent casualties to civilians or damage to civilian infrastructure.√¢‚Ç¨¬ù
√¢‚Ç¨≈ìWe are not at all afraid to receive criticism about our efforts,√¢‚Ç¨¬ù Kirby added.
The 300 fatalities are those that Amnesty considers credible, but the number is likely around 900, the report√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s author, Neil Sammonds, told RT. He said that while there were some indications that the Pentagon would try to improve the targeting of its strikes in Syria, so far this hasn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t happened.
√¢‚Ç¨≈ìUntil now the big picture in Syria is that they are not investigating thoroughly enough, they are not aware as they should be of the amount of civilians they have killed, and it means that it is quite possible that they will be killing more civilians in their campaign to retake Mosul from Islamic State.√¢‚Ç¨¬ù
He added that Amnesty was focusing on other parties in the Syrian conflict, including the Syrian government, Russia, terrorist groups and armed rebels, who, he said, are responsible for more civilian deaths than the US-led coalition, which explains why the report didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t come sooner.
Last week, Amnesty International blasted Russia for civilian deaths in Aleppo. The Syrian city is divided between government forces and various armed groups, including the Al-Qaeda offshoot Al-Nusra Front. Russia says that the militants use civilians as human shields and would not allow them to leave the city, derailing several attempts by Russia to open humanitarian corridors out of the city.

"It is an idea universally indulged that escaping to a   spot, preferably surrounded by landscapes of stunning natural beauty, will spark bouts of unnatural creativity. Four years ago, I tested that proposition when my wife and I left London for a tiny cottage in a remote valley in the Black Mountains of South Wales. It felt like another world. The view from the window was of sheep rather than the top deck of red London buses. Our nearest neighbor was a farm a   walk across three fields. We couldn‚Äôt hear them watching television or smell what they cooked for supper. I found that, true enough, with no job, no friends and no television, a lot of writing is possible. I never stopped to consider the cost. Social interaction was so rare that after weeks alone in my writing shed, my ability to regulate conversation atrophied: A friendly question in the post office would elicit a   response. I began to fear the prospect of friends visiting as a threat to my   ‚Äúspace. ‚Äù Then, after a year or more, just as the arrival of our first child transformed our isolation from a creative asset into a psychological liability, Rachel, our midwife, came with news. ‚ÄúOh, there‚Äôs another author round here whose baby I just delivered. ‚Äù Loneliness and prideful smugness did battle: An unspoken obligation loomed. The author in question turned out to be Owen Sheers. In due course, we admitted to each other the drawbacks of our rural situation. Yes, with nothing but my wife and sheep for company, I had written a second book much faster than the first. But I did like talking about books as well as writing them. In the now popular saying, cities are where ideas go to have sex. So much of contemporary cultural production and consumption takes place in urban settings, and, globally, the pace of urbanization is accelerating. Owen and I shared a latent fear: What were we missing out on? Owen knew several other writers in the area, the nonfiction writer Oliver Balch and the novelist Tom Bullough. I suggested a writers‚Äô book club to discuss a different book every month from the perspective of craft, technique, style. ‚ÄúYes, a few of us tried that before,‚Äù said Tom, wearily. ‚ÄúBut someone said something unforgivable about Gogol, and that was the end of it. ‚Äù Before the first meeting, we went to a reading and met two more. They, in turn, spread the word further and the net wider. In these hills, writers, it seemed, were more common than vermin. And their enthusiasm for the book club was palpable. To taciturn writers for whom small talk is a kind of torture, it was, I think, a convenient alibi for company. British sociability can often be a perilous obstacle course of implicit obligation where the goal of social occasions is to emerge unscathed without being caught in a web of suffocating reciprocity. We were explicitly gathered not to talk about ourselves, but about books. Now each month we assemble like a clandestine congregation of nonconformists in the basement of a charming local pub: the Bridge End Inn, Talgarth. After several months, we quickly overwhelmed our allotted table and colonized the whole room. Our membership is now pushing 18. Ideas, it seems, are desperate for their monthly hookup. So what of the product? Do the magic ingredients of peace, quiet and stimulating company make any difference to creative output? It‚Äôs hard to say. The main factor, we‚Äôd all agree, is the cost of time. Money vaporizes in London before you‚Äôve even put your hand in your pocket. But will we write different books outside the city? Maybe not immediately, but the constellation of serious writers in a rural setting is an interesting phenomenon that, I think, reflects wider changes in the global economy and climate. Artists are getting priced out of global cities, and climate change has politicized the rural in new ways. The first book we read was ‚Äú10:04,‚Äù by Ben Lerner. Although the group on the whole reacted badly to the narrow New York focus of the book, the example of the author‚Äôs supreme   of place (it is taken as   that Brooklyn is where anyone would want to live) has struck a chord in many discussions since. Away from the city, climate change as a totalizing political and cultural concern is hard to avoid. ‚ÄúHow can anyone, now, justify writing a book that is not, in some way, about our relationship to this planet,‚Äù our dear late member Rebecca Loncraine said. It would be difficult, here, to write one of those   nature books, with which Britain is currently awash, idealizing the natural world as a zone of innocence untouched by human influence. Lately, we have spent time talking, as all writers do, about the inadequacy of language of the need for a new vocabulary to describe things that humans have denatured, violated. The sea is no longer the same sea that the word initially signified. The air is no longer the air it once was, and so on. Pretentious perhaps, but urgent too. Strangely, I have met more writers in these hills than I ever knew in all the global cities in which I have lived: New York, Chicago, Nairobi, London. Not only has moving away from the city increased my productivity, but I am blessed with that rare thing: a fresh view. My citybound friends still refer to where I live as ‚Äúthe middle of nowhere,‚Äù but to me, it increasingly feels at the heart of things.",Foregin,
"October 28, 2016 Venezuela crisis enters dangerous phase as Maduro foes go militant In a curious convergence of events on the same day last week, four Venezuelan provincial courts issued identical rulings, state governors quickly hit Twitter to celebrate, then the election board emailed a short but bombshell statement. Opposition hopes for a referendum to recall President Nicolas Maduro were dashed, on grounds of fraud in an initial signature drive. The vote was off. For many in the opposition, that settled a years-old debate about the nature of Venezuela‚Äôs socialist government, uniting them in conviction they are now fighting a dictatorship. Their new militancy heightens the risk of unrest as the South American OPEC member of 30 million people grapples with a dangerous economic and political crisis. ‚ÄúCan anyone in the world now really doubt that Venezuela is living in tyranny?‚Äù said housewife Mabel Pinate, 62, dressed in white among thousands of protesters who took to the streets against Maduro on Wednesday. ‚ÄúWe are sick of this. It‚Äôs time to toughen up and do what we must to save Venezuela,‚Äù added Pinate, whose husband was fired from state oil company PDVSA by Maduro‚Äôs predecessor Hugo Chavez and whose two children have gone abroad.",Foregin,
"8. Emigre Super Blocs Part VIII:The Quasi-Legal Coup-Hillary Clinton Information Operations In Election 2016 . ‚ÄúThe purpose of ‚Äú Inform and Influence Operations ‚Äù is not to provide a perspective, opinion, or lay out a policy. It is defined as the ability to make audiences ‚Äúthink and act‚Äù in a manner favorable to the mission objectives. This is done through applying perception management techniques which target the audiences emotions, motives, and reasoning.
These techniques are not geared for debate. It is to overwhelm and change the target psyche. 
Using these techniques information sources can be manipulated and those that write, speak, or think counter to the objective are relegated as propaganda, ill-informed, or irrelevant. ~ Global Research, US Psychological Warfare in Ukraine .‚Äù 
W hat if the strife, rumor, and clamor that the world has seen in the presidential campaign were part and parcel of an Inform and Influence Operation against Americans to determine the election outcome? Bear with me for a moment as I lay out the proofs. The quote above is from an early 2015 article with the author showing what it could look like in the civilian world. 
‚Äù What would we do? Disrupt, deny, degrade, deceive, corrupt, usurp or destroy the information. The information, please don‚Äôt forget, is the ultimate objective of cyber. That will directly impact the decision-making process of the adversary‚Äôs leader who is the ultimate target.‚Äù ‚Äì Joel Harding 
IO or IIO (Inform and Influence Operations) as defined by the US Army includes the fields of psychological operations and military deception. All of this is used in the civilian world the same way by private contractors. 
In this election, private contractors were hired to focus their capacity to influence the American population. This is proven and you deserve a step by step look at it if you are voting. 
What Project Veritas shows is damning evidence of what I have been documenting in the emigre series articles since spring 2016. 
By using mainstream media, they started an integrated approach which includes influencing their political opponent‚Äôs decision making. Media is given messages that follow the same themes and fill the entire information space by using an across the board effort. The effort drowns out any other message. 
According to the Observer, this has been happening throughout the election cycle to benefit Hillary Clinton. ‚Äú Rather than informing voters to enrich democracy , the mainstream media has developed a feedback loop between support for particular candidates and the political agenda they intend to support. The freedom of the press is necessary for a democracy to function.‚Äù The article further points out that it was the media that helped rig the primaries against Bernie Sanders. 
Wikileaks has clearly shown the interplay between mainstream media and the Clinton campaign. And they have shown clearly that most of the mainstream media are working to influence the election . This goes beyond partisan electioneering. All of this follows the exact pattern, a well planned Information Operation against the American public . 
As Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton was also the Ex-Officio Board Member of the BBG . The BBG (Broadcasting Board of Governors) run RFE/RL (Radio Free Europe/ Radio Liberty). Most of the 8-member board, appointed by the President of the United States, are the who‚Äôs who of powerful media moguls in film, news, print, and radio. Appointment to the BBG is like being awarded an ambassador position for the media industry. It‚Äôs also why big media carries the same line or themes. 
The 7th member of the board of directors which runs RFE/RL is Mathew Armstrong . He is a longtime friend and mentor to retired Brigadier general Joel Harding. He provides Harding a lot of access and influence in media. Armstrong‚Äôs background is public relations. He is an expert in IO and IIO operations. His bio: Author, lecturer, and strategist on public diplomacy and international media . He has worked on traditional and emerging security issues with both civilian and military government agencies, news organizations, think tanks, and academia across several continents. 
In what appears to be a conflict of interest, at least two BBG board members are working actively for the Hillary Clinton presidential campaign. 
Karen Kornbluh is helping refine and to get Hillary Clinton‚Äôs message out. ‚Äù All of them are names to watch if Clinton wins ‚Äî and key jobs at the FCC and other federal agencies are up for grabs.‚Äù 
According to her bio : Karen founded the New America Foundation‚Äôs Work and Family Program and is a senior fellow for Digital Policy at the Council on Foreign Relations. Karen has written extensively about technology policy, women, and family policy for The Atlantic , The New York Times and The Washington Post . New York Times columnist David Brooks cited her Democracy article ‚ÄúFamilies Valued,‚Äù focused on ‚Äújuggler families‚Äù as one of the best magazine articles of 2006. Michael Kempner is the founder, President and Chief Executive Officer of MWW Group, a staunch Hillary Clinton supporter, and may get a greater role if she is elected . Kempner is a member of the Public Relations Hall of Fame. Michael Kempner hired Anthony Weiner after the sexting scandal broke in 2011. 
Jeff Shell, chairman of the BBG and Universal Filmed Entertainment is supporting a secondary role by being an honor roll donor to the Atlantic Council . While the BBG is supposed to be neutral it has continuously helped increase tensions in Eastern Europe. While giving to the Atlantic Council may not be illegal while in his position, currently, the Atlantic Council‚Äôs main effort is to ignite a war with Russia. This may set up a major conflict of interest. 
According to journalist Robert Parry ‚ÄúThe people that will be taking senior positions and especially in foreign policy believe ‚ÄúThis consensus is driven by a broad-based backlash against a president who has repeatedly stressed the dangers of overreach and the need for restraint, especially in the Middle East.‚Äù 
Parry goes on to say that at the forefront of this is the Atlantic Council, a think tank associated with NATO. Their main goal is a major confrontation with nuclear-armed Russia. 
The Atlantic Council is the think tank for the CEEC (Central and Eastern European Coalition) which is associated with NATO. The CEEC has only one goal. The question it poses to candidates that mattered is ‚ÄúAre you willing to go to war with Russia?‚Äù Hillary Clinton has received their unqualified support throughout the campaign. 
The Central and Eastern European Coalition represent the various Central and Eastern European countries to the US government. What makes them special in an election is that they control a 20 million person strong bloc vote in key states across the country and sway elections by themselves. The price of a Clinton win is war with Russia. 
While the rest of the BBG board support Clinton‚Äôs proposed policy of closing Syrian airspace, the CEEC wants it because it will mean direct conflict with Russia. Hillary Clinton‚Äôs first foray into Islamic politics led to genocide and made the way for ISIS setting up training camps in Kosovo. Hillary Clinton has been friendly with jihadists for as long as she has had a national political career. According to US Special Forces on the ground in Syria training the moderates, there are NO moderates to train . 
Green Berets are forced to train jihadis that they know will eventually attack us. Support our troops? Give them good, honorable missions. They deserve better, don‚Äôt they? 
As you go through the above links, the information is staggering. Shown are large groups of people strategically located in swing states that will do anything to get her elected. The question is why? 
Politically, we have a two party system. If you say you are Republican, people have at least a general idea of what you mean. For Democrats, it‚Äôs no different. There are different kinds of politics that fit easily under each umbrella. But the point is they are recognizable and we know where they stand on issues. 
Tell me, what are OUNb beliefs? OUNb is a political party and set of beliefs just like Republican or Democrat. The reason I am asking is that you can‚Äôt tell me. The odds are you haven‚Äôt heard about it before. When the Atlantic Council or The Project for the New American Century takes all the senior positions in the Clinton White House, it will be filled with OUNb and similar political partisans for the first time without dissenting voices. 
‚ÄúUnity to act when required has been the diaspora‚Äôs mantra ‚Äì this cannot be disputed . 
As time moves on, we see that things take a natural course. We see that two wings of the OUN ‚Äì (OUNb)Banderivtsi and (OUNm)Melnykivtsi ‚Äì are working actively on the international level, working in partnership and currently are in strong negotiations about becoming a single entity again.‚Äù 
The OUNb political party started under Stepan Bandera and their political beliefs are quite literally Nazi. In the 1930‚Äôs they swore undying loyalty to Adolf Hitler and the Diaspora was directing Waffen SS battalions from America secretly even as other Ukrainian emigres were fighting them. The UCCA is the head of OUNb thought in America and now they want America to celebrate their totalitarian beliefs with them. If you disagree with totalitarian politics, you are the enemy. After a brief description of what kind of beliefs the people have from the Atlantic Council that are taking up cabinet positions, the proof it is happening now follows. 
The OUNb were the SS that manned the concentration camps during the Holocaust. They successfully murdered 3 million war prisoners by starving them to death. The OUNb killed over 250,000 Jews, 500,000 Ukrainians, and committed the first Holocaust at Babi Yar. Today the UCCA is funding and running the volunteer battalions raping and killing in Donbass the same way. 
They and the other emigre group leaders are also behind buying the media headlines and reach, damage control, and the Information Operation against Americans today. If you want to know what American politics will look like within a few years, look at Ukraine. 
There are people who live abroad, who do not feel fully accepted as a minority, and here there is a phenomenon which I call long-distance nationalism. . .The members of the diaspora create for themselves an image of the home land, which is a stronger emotional investment than the country in which they live‚Ä¶One negative consequence of the diaspora experience is the emergence of what Ander-son calls non-responsible politics: diaspora participation in the politics in the country with which they identify can often be toxic, and their impact can be felt through the funding of particular political figures, nationalist propaganda, and even weapons‚Ä¶- Multiculturalism, memory, and ritualization: Ukrainian nationalist monuments in Edmonton, Alberta ‚Äì Pers Anders Rudling 
With the field day the Emigres and paid media had with Donald Trump over David Duke, they forgot to tell you that Ukrainian emigres supporting Hillary Clinton hired Duke in Ukraine as a professor of history and sent their American kids to learn there. Almost all Ukrainian politicians have been through this fascist education system known as MAUP . The Ukrainian American and other likeminded ethnics are the people that will fill the senior foreign and domestic cabinet positions. 
‚Äú OUNb leader Ivan Kobasa also took responsibility of making sure the Ukrainian-Americans received the proper secondary education at Ukrainian nationalist schools(MAUP) in Ukraine. From the mid-2000‚Äôs enrollment in this educational system has skyrocketed into the hundreds of thousands. Today almost all members of the current Ukrainian government are graduates of this ideological system that was taught to them by moderates like David Duke who is also a graduate of the MAUP system.‚Äù 
‚ÄúI do care about social and economic issues affecting every American, but given the war in Ukraine, there is only one issue that we as Ukrainian Americans must focus on: Ukraine . 
The Ukrainian issue ‚Äútrumps‚Äù all other personal issues! 
A vote for Trump is a vote against Ukraine! 
When it comes to U.S. elections, Ukrainian Americans are a statistically minor, divided, unorganized voting group. The Central and East European Coalition is a coalition of U.S.-based organizations that represent their countries of heritage, a voting group of over 20 million people. The Ukrainian Congress Committee of America and the Ukrainian National Association are member organizations of the CEEC. Americans of East and Central European heritage can make a significant difference and influence the election result if their attention is focused.‚Äù Ukraine Weekly The Presidential Election: Can We Make A Difference 
Hillary Clinton‚Äôs response is she will defend Ukraine‚Äôs borders! Even though it has no eastern or northern border to defend. She has guaranteed to start a war with Russia if she is elected. 
Not only is Clinton buying the media through these second parties, but they are hiring professional, former military psyops professionals to deny pertinent information from voters and disrupt her political opponents message. At the same time, they are paying an across the board mainstream media to simultaneously publish articles and video that lift her campaign up, disrupt, destroy, and drown out alternate messages. 
Wikileaks noted this when it exposed the Clinton campaign‚Äôs program to incite violence and obfuscate the point. The Huffington Post example of this is‚Äù Editor‚Äôs note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar , rampant xenophobe , racist , misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims ‚Äî 1.6 billion members of an entire religion ‚Äî from entering the U.S‚Äù. 
‚Äú We understand the Clinton camp has hired beaucoup and Zwanzig (a lot) of trolls, we also understand the Kremlin has done the same. We just do not know if Trump has followed suit. From a counterintelligence perspective, this is confusing as heck. 
One of the really neat things about this election is seeing all my information operations and information warfare friends on social media, contributing and commenting, looking darned intelligent! Theirs is normally the voice of reason, maturity, and intelligence.‚Äù Joel Harding 
By systematically and continually attacking the voter‚Äôs psyche, Americans are being treated in the same way our government treats countries they overthrow . The right to make an informed vote has been denied to support any particular candidate. 
What does an Inform and Influence Operation entail against the American public? Read the following carefully. The term ‚Äúanti-western‚Äù refers to anyone that disagrees with whom he is working for. In this case, he works for the Ukrainian Emigres. This also covers Syria. Every media outlet or journalist writing about these subjects that aren‚Äôt carrying the line he lays out is the enemy. These are the tactics being used today during the election. 
‚ÄúI am building a database of planners , operators, logisticians, hackers, and anyone wanting to be involved with special activities I will call ‚Äòinform and influence activities‚Äô. I have received a few different suggestions to help organize operations ‚Äì of all sorts ‚Äì against anti-Western elements. No government approval, assistance or funding. This skirts legalities. This is not explicitly illegal and it may not even be legal, at this point. That grey area extends a long way. I am only trying to assess the availability of people willing to participate in such efforts. Technology, equipment and facility offers are also appreciated. If you would like to be included in my database, please send a tailored resume to joel_harding@‚Äù

With his resume, no guess work is needed to understand how effective his friends are. Before going further, ask yourself if this is what elections are supposed to be? 
As a litmus test take Hillary‚Äôs name out and put down what is known just through Wikileaks in a list. Put McCain‚Äôs name, Kucinich, Paul, Bush, and ask yourself would this be an acceptable candidate? Add what‚Äôs been shown here. Is there an acceptable candidate? 
If any of them would be acceptable, sorry like many others you drank the kool-aid already. 
‚Äú I‚Äôve seen how our heroes, activists , journalists, and celebrities have completely sold their souls to support something no person with an iota of morality would do. I‚Äôve seen them say and do things to derail candidates who would have been a million times better for those less fortunate around us. It‚Äôs unfortunate most pretend to fight the establishment, to act like they love the people more than they love the struggle and the relevance that it brings them. I am not one of those and I won‚Äôt continue to be until the good Lord takes me.‚Äù Cesar Vargas 
Hillary Clinton is not a Nazi. But every position of relevance will be filled with people that really are political Nazis. They are technically integral nationalists. They look down on democracy in any form. At least now you know what kind of government you are voting for. 
Regardless of who wins, there are 2000 tanks, artillery, and rockets pointed my way, waiting for this election to be over. I am an American that lives in Donbass, and wrote many of the early breaking stories and much of the background about the conflict in Ukraine. 
If you cannot objectively look and see a more sophisticated version of what happened here through 2014 is going on, I can‚Äôt help you. Soon the OUNb will order the volunteer battalions to start killing civilians on a large scale again. I will go back to reporting on the war. 
If all these things weren‚Äôt being done, I would keep it simply about policy. Russia is not an enemy of the United States. Instead, I believe I am witnessing a quiet coup that demands legality in America. 
If this Information Operation is allowed to win the 2016 presidency, then elections are fruitless. Every other election will be based on the same strategy. They will have to be for any candidate to win.

"at 11:54 am 4 Comments 
When it comes to the Clintons, where there‚Äôs smoke, there‚Äôs usually a structure fire. I doubt Haiti is any different. 
With that in mind, I wanted to flag an article published earlier today at the BBC , What really happened with the Clintons in Haiti? 
Here are some excerpts: Donald Trump has said the work of Bill and Hillary Clinton in Haiti was a ‚Äúdisgrace‚Äù. What really happened? 
‚ÄúThe Clinton family, they are crooks, they are thieves, they are liars,‚Äù says Haitian activist Dahoud Andre. 
He has been leading protests outside the Clinton Foundation headquarters in Manhattan and Hillary Clinton‚Äôs presidential campaign base in Brooklyn for the last two years. 
He said protesters from his small activist group, the Committee to Mobilize Against Dictatorship in Haiti, will continue to level their allegations ‚Äì so far all unproven ‚Äì if the Democratic candidate wins the White House. 
Mrs Clinton retorted that she was proud of the foundation‚Äôs work, and pointed out her rival‚Äôs namesake charity had spent money on a lifesize portrait of himself. 
The Clintons‚Äô history with the world‚Äôs first black republic dates back to their 1975 honeymoon, when they met a voodoo priest and visited a hotel where Ernest Hemingway once stayed. 
Mr Andre is not alone among his compatriots in blaming the once-and-perhaps-future first couple for a litany of ills in Haiti. 
Kim Ives, editor of Haiti Liberte newspaper, told the BBC: ‚ÄúA lot of Haitians are not big fans of the Clintons, that‚Äôs for sure.‚Äù 
‚ÄúThe fact the Clintons kind of took over things after the earthquake and did a pretty poor job of it translates to why the Haitians have a pretty dim view of them,‚Äù he added. 
So what happened? 
Mrs Clinton was Secretary of State and Mr Clinton was UN Special Envoy to Haiti when the January 2010 earthquake struck, killing an estimated 220,000 people. 
Some $13.3bn (¬£10.9bn) was pledged by international donors for Haiti‚Äôs recovery. 
Mr Clinton was appointed co-chairman of the Interim Haiti Recovery Commission (IHRC), along with Haitian Prime Minister Jean-Max Bellerive. 
But the IHRC found itself under fire as frustrations mounted at the slow pace of recovery. 
Its mandate was not renewed by the Haitian parliament in 2011. 
How about this graphic‚Ä¶ 
A US Government Accountability Office report discovered no hint of wrongdoing, but concluded the IHRC‚Äôs decisions were ‚Äúnot necessarily aligned with Haitian priorities‚Äù. 
The GAO must have a peculiar definition of ‚Äúwrongdoing.‚Äù 
Mr Clinton‚Äôs own office at the UN found 9% of the foreign aid cash went to the Haitian government and 0.6% to local organizations. 
The bulk of it went to UN agencies, international aid groups, private contractors and donor countries‚Äô own civilian and military agencies. 
For example, the Pentagon billed the State Department hundreds of millions of dollars for sending US troops to hand out bottled water and keep order on the streets of Haiti‚Äôs ravaged capital, Port-au-Prince. 
Jake Johnston, an analyst with the Center for Economic and Policy Research, a nonpartisan group that has studied the quake reconstruction, told the BBC ‚Äúit‚Äôs hard to say it‚Äôs been anything other than a failure‚Äù. 
But he believes the State Department and IHRC simply replicated the mistakes of the whole foreign aid industry by chasing short-term gains instead of building longer-term capacity on the ground. 
‚ÄúThey relied too much on outside actors,‚Äù Mr Johnston says, ‚Äúand supplanted the role of the Haitian government and domestic producers.‚Äù 
After the earthquake, disaster capitalists flocked to the nation of 10 million people, which is about the size of the US state of Massachusetts. 
Private contractors were eager to sell services, in what one US envoy described in a Wikileaks-disclosed diplomatic cable as a ‚Äúgold rush‚Äù. 
In email exchanges with top Clinton Foundation officials, a senior aide to Mrs Clinton, who was then-secretary of state, kept an eye out for those identified by the abbreviations ‚ÄúFOB‚Äù (friends of Bill Clinton) or ‚ÄúWJC VIPs‚Äù (William Jefferson Clinton VIPs). 
‚ÄúNeed you to flag when people are friends of WJC,‚Äù wrote Caitlin Klevorick, a senior State Department official who was vetting incoming offers of assistance coming through the Clinton Foundation. 
The emails, which were obtained through a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit by the Republican National Committee, have fuelled claims the Clintons were running a pay-to-play operation, though no hard evidence of this has emerged. 
House Republicans are already laying the groundwork for a volley of congressional hearings into the Clinton Foundation in the event the Democratic candidate wins the White House in a week‚Äôs time. 
Possibly the most enduring criticism of the Clinton Foundation‚Äôs work in Haiti stems from its signature project, a garment factory known as the Caracol Industrial Park. 
The foundation, working with the Clinton State Department, helped arrange a US-subsidised deal with the Haitian government to build the $300m factory complex in 2012. 
Several hundred farmers were evicted from their land to make way for the 600-acre manufacturing site, which produces clothes for retailers such as Old Navy, Walmart and Target. 
South Korean textile giant Sae-A Trading Co, which is the main employer at the facility, subsequently donated between $50,000 to $100,000 to the Clinton Foundation. 
Mr Clinton declared 100,000 jobs would be created ‚Äúin short order‚Äù. 
But the Caracol Industrial Park has created only 8,000 jobs. 
In the Little Haiti neighbourhood of Miami that was visited by Mr Trump this September, the head of a local women‚Äôs advocacy group has questions for Mrs Clinton. 
Marleine Bastien, executive director of Fanm Ayisyen Nan Miyami, believes that Clinton-backed projects have helped global investors more than they have benefited poverty-stricken Haitians. 
She told the BBC: ‚ÄúThe more Secretary Clinton refrains from responding to the concerns and questions from the people of Haiti, this perception that she‚Äôs trying to evade responding will continue. 
‚ÄúInstead of allowing these questions to linger and fester, why not come clean? The questions will not go away, they will continue.‚Äù 
Come clean? This is the Clintons we‚Äôre talking about.

Officials on Mr. Obama‚Äôs national security team challenged the assertion that Mr. Bossert had been elevated to a higher position than his counterpart in the current administration, Lisa Monaco, who also has the title assistant to the president. A senior national security official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss personnel matters relating to the incoming administration, noted that Ms. Monaco was the chairwoman of the Principals Committee of the Homeland Security Council, had a seat on the National Security Council and participated alongside the national security adviser during daily national security briefings for Mr. Obama. The new designation for Mr. Bossert may suggest a desire by the new administration to reconfigure the national security apparatus at the White House. Before Mr. Obama, the homeland security adviser oversaw a staff that was separate from the one run by the national security adviser. Mr. Obama combined those into a single, unified staff when he came into office. Mr. Trump may be thinking about splitting them again. In the statement, Mr. Trump called Mr. Bossert ‚Äúan invaluable asset‚Äù and praised the breadth of experience he would bring to the new administration. ‚ÄúHe has a handle on the complexity of homeland security, counterterrorism and cybersecurity challenges,‚Äù Mr. Trump said. Mr. Bossert served as deputy homeland security adviser for Mr. Bush, and he runs a risk management consulting firm in Washington. He is also a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council, working on the research institution‚Äôs Cyber Statecraft Initiative. Helping to protect the country from cybercrimes is likely to be a major focus for Mr. Bossert in light of the hacking of the Democratic National Committee and other incidents in recent years. Mr. Bossert will face the challenge of balancing cybersecurity needs against the privacy concerns of internet companies. ‚ÄúWe must work toward cyber doctrine that reflects the wisdom of free markets, private competition and the important but limited role of government in establishing and enforcing the rule of law, honoring the rights of personal property, the benefits of free and fair trade, and the fundamental principles of liberty,‚Äù Mr. Bossert said in the statement announcing his appointment. News of Mr. Bossert‚Äôs selection drew praise from some members of Congress and former colleagues in the Bush administration, who described him as capable and knowledgeable about threats to the country. Representative Jim Langevin, Democrat of Rhode Island, also praised the choice. Mr. Langevin, a founder of the Congressional Cybersecurity Caucus, said Mr. Bossert had approached the issues of cyberthreats in a ‚Äúcentrist, bipartisan‚Äù manner. ‚ÄúI also hope that he will impress upon the   the vital national security concerns tied to Russian information warfare activities, and I encourage him to work closely with Congress in attempting to build our resilience and our defenses to forestall such operations in the future,‚Äù Mr. Langevin said in a statement. Frances F. Townsend, who was Mr. Bush‚Äôs homeland security adviser, said she was confident that Mr. Bossert would ‚Äúcontinue to demonstrate the capacity and insight needed to take on the tough challenges facing the country. ‚Äù She focused in particular on Mr. Bossert‚Äôs expertise in another key part of the job: responding to natural disasters and other crises that require coordination among the White House, governors and other state officials. In a brief text message, Ms. Townsend called Mr. Bossert a ‚Äúgreat pick‚Äù and recalled that he had helped lead the ‚Äú  review‚Äù after Hurricane Katrina in 2005, helping to create more than 100 recommendations about how to better respond to such crises. ‚ÄúTom knows the importance of   partnerships and most importantly how best to establish and strengthen them,‚Äù she said. Also on Tuesday, the transition team formally announced that Jason D. Greenblatt, the chief legal officer of the Trump Organization and a longtime adviser to Mr. Trump, would serve as his special representative for international negotiations. Mr. Greenblatt has been the  ‚Äôs business attorney for years, and in a statement, Mr. Trump called him ‚Äúone of my closest and most trusted advisers. ‚Äù ‚ÄúHe has a history of negotiating substantial, complex transactions on my behalf, as well as the expertise to bring parties together and build consensus on difficult and sensitive topics,‚Äù Mr. Trump said. As the president‚Äôs special representative, Mr. Greenblatt is likely to focus on peace between the Israelis and the Palestinians, renegotiating trade agreements and the relationship between the United States and Cuba, among other international issues.",Foregin,

"By John Kaminski on October 30, 2016 John Kaminski ‚Äî The Rebel.org Oct 24, 2016 Dark secrets remain unrevealed as society‚Äôs fabric disintegrates Why is every major politician surrounded by Jewish ‚Äòadvisers‚Äô? 
Too many things don‚Äôt make sense. 
What makes us act against our own best interests? 
Why are we Americans encircling Russia with tanks and missiles? Why do we create our own terrorists and bomb our own allies? Why do we blow up our own buildings and claim that the crime was done by terrorists who simply cannot be found? What do the misanthropes who operate the gears of power want by causing constant conflict? 
Sometimes Washington reminds me of the Old Testament, ruled by a wrathful God who orders us to kill those whose property we wish to steal. Why would we hire the most odious criminals in the world to butcher the inhabitants of Middle Eastern countries? I mean, whose work are we doing by these actions, covertly funding Israel-friendly Arab radicals to demolish nations who refuse to do our bidding? 
There can be only one answer. America is no longer run by Americans. Because the same people who commit the crimes own the newspapers and TV networks, most Americans don‚Äôt realize their country has long ago been taken away by the very international bankers Henry Ford warned us about, who Adolf Hitler warned us about. 
Now Ford and Hitler are the most widely reviled personalities from the 20th century. Not a day goes by when you don‚Äôt hear something nasty about them. They tried to stop the Jewish takeover of reality. The tidal wave of Jew-owned white noise media overwhelmed them. 
What most people still don‚Äôt realize is that none of these neocon wars would have happened had Hitler won World War II. He never wanted to conquer anyone. He only wanted the return of Germany‚Äôs ancestral lands, which had been stolen by the Jewish allies (US, Britain, USSR) after World War I. 
All the horror stories about Hitler are projected Jewish fantasies that have dominated the Western airwaves for a half century. They are meant to obscure Hitler‚Äôs economic miracle and the path to a financial future free of the vampire Jews. 
Hitler floated seven peace proposals prior to World War II. But because he had challenged the Jewish monopoly of control of the world‚Äôs financial affairs, the Jews would let him have no peace. The secret Jew Roosevelt pushed the levers of war. Winston Churchill started bombing the first day he took office. 
Think of all the wars that have been spawned by the Jewish murder machine since that time, the 1940s. It‚Äôs impossible to say that none of them would have happened, but had Hitler won, the Jews would not now be strutting around the world using U.S. military might as its brutal enforcer to rob all nations of the their most valuable possessions, and even more chilling, to stamp out all traces of opposition to their psychopathological hijacking of everyone‚Äôs reality. 
You can‚Äôt live a normal life because of the Jews, harvesting and neutering everything they encounter, like some robot parasite destined to suck the life out of the world, as Hitler and Ford both warned us about, turning your food into poison and your daughters into tramps. 
There is no one to turn to for help. Turn to the wrong person and you can get killed. 
Call the cops and your pet‚Äôs as good as dead. 
Anywhere in the white United States, if you saw a woman being raped by 20 men on the street, everyone‚Äôs first impulse would be to stop the crime, or at least report it to the cops. 
Not so in the ugly deserts of the Middle East, where insane Arab terrorists hired by Jews and Americans commit the most barbaric crimes in order to blame these false flag atrocities on people it means to exterminate, a task for which any excuse will do for these world famous killers. 
This is the real American personality, the goons who hired those al-Qaeda mercenaries to rape and kill Qaddafi in the streets, people like Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama. Stone cold killers. And they laugh about it. 
If you were in your right mind, you wouldn‚Äôt ever trust people like this. 
America gassed those hundreds of children in Syria and tried to blame it on Assad. People finally began to realize that nothing the U.S. government ever says is true. The terrorists who supposedly slit people‚Äôs throats are so over-the-top because they are all a Hollywood act < http://www.globalresearch.ca/isis-beheadings-of-journalists-cia-admitted-to-staging-fake-jihadist-videos-in-2010/5399345 >. 
Americans have begun to realize that they are the killers they thought they had been fighting. It turns out the fight has just begun. 
Unglued. Society is becoming unglued. The fabric of society is disintegrating. What horrific chaos is sure to follow can only be envisioned by our most harrowing nightmares. 
There are no explanations that adequately describe what exactly is happening to the world at the present time except to note that things that once seemed to work now no longer do. 
It seems like freedom has been devalued and shackled, and governments make too many decisions the people never wanted, like the World Wars, the Great Depression and the War on Drugs. 
To be an American today is like living in a grand old steamship that is not so slowly sinking into a jellified ocean, petrified minds in a viscous sea of misinformation, afraid to challenge orders they know are lies, sliding into oblivion without a clue that they are doing so. 
The separation of the population into chosen and neglected applies to all religions, guaranteeing perpetual sectarian strife. Those who are chosen believe it is their right to rob and kill whomever they choose, that they are simply following the laws of nature and the personalized deity they choose to hallucinate. 
Governments have adopted this policy. Peace is achieved when robbers agree to divide the spoils. The rest of the people are left to scramble for scraps. It has always been this way, I think. 
The government overreach to extend help to needy immigrants is really part of a ploy to dilute the American electorate into undereducated slaves who will support the government through any atrocity because it is the government that is keeping them alive. 
This is how the Democrats guarantee themselves a majority of citizens too grateful for the financial help to ever quarrel with the government‚Äôs expansionist objectives and its continuing restrictions on individual rights. 
There are simply too many subjects to be addressed, to be worried about. 
They swathe all the final cuts of vegetables, right before it goes to market, with Glyphosate, to make sure everyone gets poisoned. 
Step in brackish Louisiana water with a cut on your foot and your body will completely disintegrate in a few weeks. 
The fallacy of the cloister regiments us into soldier slaves, causing us to murder those who disagree with what we say. 
The more technology increases the faster human abilities dissipate. 
The flaw of democracy is that the people with the money can convince the people with the guns to start shooting at any time. 
The government has blackmailed states into implementing a Communist agenda that reduces the intelligence of citizens. 
So many lies told over so many years. 
As long as we try to see things through the toxic filter of Jewish media, what we see will be a mirage that aims to mislead, exploit or destroy us. Coming unglued. 
The world is coming unglued. 
Like the Atlantic Gulfstream, the circadian rhythm of the planet has been disrupted. 
Ever since it was discovered that men will kill each other over practically anything, there have been those who will cultivate disagreements for profit, such as weapons makers who seek to widen their markets by endlessly promoting conflict, or newspaper owners who fan the flames of discord and scandal and watch their profits skyrocket. 
It‚Äôs like we‚Äôre all spectators at the old Roman Coliseum only instead of some hapless prisoner getting chewed up by lions, the stakes in this entertainment are if the beast wins much of the known world will be turned to rubble and most of us will be suddenly dead. This is no exaggeration. Just ask the people in Syria or any of a dozen other countries that Israel, using U.S. muscle, has destroyed. 
It‚Äôs like the shadow of Judaism casts its evil pall over every area of human endeavor, pollutes everything, cheapens our lives, makes everything artificial. Why do Jews seek to murder the natural? 
Why do they strive toward wanting to be everyone‚Äôs jailer and demanding immunity for their obnoxious crimes against humanity, whom they call beasts while their heckling Heebs twitch and moan to the insanities of their so-called holy book. 
They suck the blood of their babies‚Äô penises. How insane do you have to be? 
Failure to identify this threat and solve this mystery has now placed human society in absolute peril, as the majority of human beings sinks into a second class consciousness, while those with the keys to kosher success join the ranks of ruthless guards keeping watch on a world of pathetic prisoners. 
Too many things don‚Äôt make sense. 
Is our fear of death so strong that we have to destroy ourselves to prove we are immune to it? Better yet would be acknowledgment of its inevitability that would create a clearer view of who we are and what we‚Äôre doing. 
Because what we‚Äôre doing now, and how we are proceeding further into this toxic reality we have created for ourselves, offers us no future except and increasing decay and corruption that the Jews seem to love so much. Like bloodthirsty vultures they look for stricken carcasses on the road that they can devour in their insatiable drive to consume the whole world and everything in it. 
The Jews intend to kill everything natural and replace it with a Jewish product that can be controlled from afar. They will fail in this attempt and likely destroy humanity in the process. 
In any case, we are well on our way to being completely regimented with independent consciousness no longer an option. 
We have no fix on the future. Neither presidential candidate offers us a way out of our trouble because neither will admit the overwhelming control inflicted by the Jews on the whole world is leading to a mindless police state in which our only thought will be to serve the state no matter how cruel and depraved that assignment might be. 
To disagree with the aims of the Jewish monster state is to court your own death, or at least to be slandered and ostracized by people you thought were your friends. 
Too many things don‚Äôt make sense. What unexplored dark corner of our brains would make us create our own enemy in order to keep our fellows enslaved and exploited?

"Trump Jr. Suspiciously Helps Arizona Woman Push Stalled Car, Uses It As A Photo Op (VIDEO) By Stephanie Kuklish   
It is amazing how Trump Jr., known for his rich boy attitude, would suddenly feel the need to get out and help push a stalled car while campaigning in, the now swing state, Arizona . 
Of course, he didn‚Äôt leave without a photo op or video footage being recorded. Tyler Bower, the Maricopa County Republican Party Chairman, posted the footage on Twitter and told the Arizona Republic : ‚ÄúShe was just stunned. She was taken aback.‚Äù This is why I'm voting Trump! @DonaldJTrumpJr helping push a ladies car off the road in 101 degree heat in Arizona after a rally today #MAGA pic.twitter.com/ngp1ZhS8Wm 
‚Äî Tyler Bowyer (@conservatyler) October 27, 2016 
Even the woman who Trump Jr. helped was extremely surprised that any politician would stop to push a car to the side of the road. And seeing as Arizona has been stampeded by Republican rallies this season, it‚Äôs a little hard to believe this just happened to take place in Arizona. AZCentral talked about Trump‚Äôs presence in the swing state stating : ‚ÄúDonald Trump, whose grip on Arizona‚Äôs 11 electoral votes appears to be in jeopardy, will appear in downtown Phoenix for a Saturday rally, his seventh Arizona event this election season.‚Äù 
Arizona, a historically red state through and through, has now been determined as a swing state for the 2016 election season. Arizona residents began evening out their party preference when Republican presidential nominee, Donald Trump, started making insane remarks about building walls to keep out immigrants and having Mexico pay for it. We are sure his tasteless conversations and sexual assault allegations didn‚Äôt help the situation at all. 
Arizona being a border state is no stranger to immigrant issues, but even with Trump‚Äôs hardcore attack on border patrol, Arizona residents still think he is a little hard to swallow. A collaborated effort between The Arizona Republic , Morrison Institute For Public Policy , and The Cronkite School of Journalism and Mass Communication resulted in a poll showing Democratic presidential nominee, Hillary Clinton pulling ahead of Trump in the election. Data from Arizona Republic/Morrison/Cronkite News poll from Oct.10-15,2016 
If Arizona votes for Hillary Clinton it will be the second non-red candidate that Arizona has ever voted for, the last being Mrs. Clinton‚Äôs husband, Bill Clinton in 1996. 
Though Trump Jr. made an interesting choice when showing his caring side, we still don‚Äôt think it will help his dad win over, what should have been, one of the easiest states for the Trump campaign to snag.

"A Muslim faith healer has been arrested for the brutal drugging and stabbing of 20 of his disciples at a Sufi shrine in Punjab, Pakistan. [The victims of the massacre were reportedly drugged with   food, stripped naked and then killed with a dagger and stick. Along with the 20 dead, four more people were wounded in the incident, which occurred around midnight between Saturday and Sunday. The four are in critical condition.  The alleged perpetrator of the crime is the    shrine custodian and faith healer Abdul Waheed, who confessed that he killed these people because he feared that they had come to kill him, according to regional police chief Zulfiqar Hameed. ‚ÄúThe suspect appears to be paranoid and psychotic, or it could be related to rivalry for the control of shrine,‚Äù Hameed said. Pervaiz Haider, a doctor in the hospital treating the survivors of the incident, said most of the dead were hit on the back of the neck. ‚ÄúThere are bruises and wounds inflicted by a club and dagger on the bodies of victims,‚Äù he said. Waheed was known for erratic behavior but was popular as a faith healer. ‚ÄúLocal people say Abdul used to beat the visitors who came to him for treatment of various physical or spiritual ailments,‚Äù local rescue service official Mazhar Shah said. ‚ÄúSometimes he would remove the clothes of his visitors and burn them. ‚Äù According to Deputy Commissioner Liaqut Ali Chatha, people would come to the shrine for cleansing their sins and allow the caretakers to beat them with clubs. ‚ÄúBut in this case the visitors were first drugged and then stabbed with daggers and hit with clubs, apparently during the cleansing process,‚Äù Chatha said. The shrine was built two and a half years ago and named after the late boxer Mohammed Ali, a convert to Islam. It has become a popular place of pilgrimage and healing for Sufi Muslims. Two other suspects were reportedly arrested together with Waheed. Many hardline Muslims regard Sufis as heretics because of the mystical element of their tradition. Earlier this year, militants of the Islamic State ( ) carried out a massive suicide bombing on a prominent Sufi Muslim shrine in Pakistan, killing up to 88 people and wounding more than 300 others. Last November, another Islamic State attack at a Sufi shrine in   Pakistan left a least 52 people dead and more than 100 others injured.

"  In this Ted Talk , Michael Murphy discusses how his father‚Äôs brush with death ultimately opened the doors to his own life path of architecture, but not just as a profession, and not just as a creative expression. When designing, Murphy and his team go beyond the blueprint, considering things like how like airflow and light can produce both a healthy community and gorgeous structures. He shows us his projects in countries like Rwanda and Haiti, and covers his plan for creating The Memorial to Peace and Justice, which mainly aims to heal hearts in the American South. ‚Äú Why was it that the best architects, the greatest architecture ‚Äî a ll beautiful and visionary and innovative ‚Äî is also so rare, and seems to serve so very few? And more to the point: With all of this creative talent, what more could we do?‚Äù Murphy poses in his talk. He broke into the very soul of his work when he came to the realization that buildings are actually making people sicker.   ‚Äú In this hospital in South Africa, patients that came in with, say, a broken leg, to wait in this unventilated hallway, walked out with a multidrug-resistant strand of tuberculosis. Simple designs for infection control had not been thought about, and people had died because of it.‚Äù With the revelation that hospitals are making patients sicker, he thought of designing one that flips the hallways on the outside, allowing people to walk in the exterior. ‚Äú If mechanical systems rarely work, what if we could design a hospital that could breathe through natural ventilation, and meanwhile reduce its environmental footprint?‚Äù he said. He then discussed the incredible community aspect of following through with his healing niche in the architecture world. ‚Äú We worked with Bruce Nizeye, a brilliant engineer, and he thought about construction differently than I had been taught in school. When we had to excavate this enormous hilltop and a bulldozer was expensive and hard to get to site, Bruce suggested doing it by hand, using a method in Rwanda called ‚ÄúUbudehe,‚Äù which means ‚Äúcommunity works for the community.‚Äù Hundreds of people came with shovels and hoes, and we excavated that hill in half the time and half the cost of that bulldozer. Instead of importing furniture, Bruce started a guild, and he brought in master carpenters to train others in how to make furniture by hand. And on this job site, 15 years after the Rwandan genocide, Bruce insisted that we bring on labor from all backgrounds, and that half of them be women. ‚Äú Ultimately, the healing journey became twofold, as it was both the process of building to heal as well as allowing an entire community to heal. ‚ÄúWe call this the locally fabricated way of building, or ‚Äòlo-fab,‚Äô and it has four pillars: hire locally, source regionally, train where you can and most importantly, think about every design decision as an opportunity to invest in the dignity of the places where you serve. Think of it like the local food movement, but for architecture. And we‚Äôre convinced that this way of building can be replicated across the world, and change the way we talk about and evaluate architecture,‚Äù he explained. In his talk, Murphy reveals how he learned that architecture is more than what it seems. It ‚Äúcan be a transformative engine for change.‚Äù Watch the full talk below. Perhaps it will show you how your work can be more than what it seems, too.

"Africa , China , Hybrid Wars , United States By Andrew KORYBKO (USA) 
The most colonized and exploited continent in the history of the world is once more the center of global competition, albeit this time the form of rivalry between the Great Powers has taken on a much more nuanced, though no less intense, form. The US, France, and their unipolar allies want to retain Africa as their exclusive labor, market, and resource reserve for the foreseeable future, both out of their own material self-interest and with the added strategic benefit of depriving China and others of its economic fruits. Contrarily, China wants to integrate the world‚Äôs fastest growing economies and populations into the unfolding multipolar world order and give them a fair chance at succeeding in the global system. The contrast between the West‚Äôs neo-colonialism and China‚Äôs liberating sovereignty couldn‚Äôt be more crisp, and it‚Äôs this opposition of diametrically opposed global strategies and development models that sets the stage for the grand proxy battle between the US and China over Africa. 
Just as much as China needs Africa in order to maintain its steady growth rates into the foreseeable future and ensure its domestic stability, so too does the US want to ‚Äòpoach‚Äô Africa from China in order to offset the structural sustainability of its number one rival‚Äôs global leadership. The nature of the African-wide proxy conflict is that China is ardently working to finance, construct, and connect various infrastructural projects to one another in order to create a supraregional web of intermodal transport corridors that could then perfectly complement the maritime portion of the One Belt One Road (‚ÄúNew Silk Road‚Äù) global vision, while the US is trying with equal fervor to seize control of key nodes along these transnational routes as well as strategically disrupt crucial portions in order to increase China‚Äôs dependence on the unipolar-influenced areas. As the ultimate last resort, however, the US, the ‚Äúworld island‚Äù in all the manners that it can be strategically understood as, will pull out all the stops and unleash a ‚Äòscorched earth‚Äô trail of Hybrid War destruction in its wake while it strategically retreats back to its self-sufficient ‚ÄúFortress North America‚Äù as the final coup de grace in the African proxy war against China. 
More than likely, it won‚Äôt ever get to that dramatic of an absolute point whereby the US fully retreats from Africa or totally destroys the continent with Hybrid War, but realistically speaking, there‚Äôll likely be a blended development of scenarios that takes place in this heated theater of competition over the coming decades that integrates elements of both extremes. China will predictably succeed in spearheading several ultra-strategic New Silk Road development corridors in Africa, while the US will probably sabotage a few others and unleash a handful of Hybrid Wars to keep the existing ways indefinitely at bay from fully actualizing their envisioned geo-economic potential. There‚Äôs no surefire way to know with absolutely certainty what the future will bring, but it‚Äôs possible to acquire an educated expectation about the structural and systemic manner in which the identified group of states will be targeted by US-provoked Hybrid Wars. Even accounting for the possibility that some of the forthcoming examined scenarios might be ‚Äúnaturally occurring‚Äù in that they require little if any external pressure to instigate, there‚Äôs still a strong likelihood that at least some of the investigated possibilities will eventually occur to varying extents and that the geopolitical repercussions will indisputably impact quite negatively on China and the larger multipolar world‚Äôs grand position in the New Cold War. 
This section of the book is organized in such a manner that Part I will describe Africa‚Äôs overall geopolitical situation, highlighting the influence of hegemonic and institutional regionalism (sometimes overlapping, other times not) over the continent‚Äôs affairs in order to clearly illustrate the preexisting advantages and obstacles to China‚Äôs New Silk Road vision. The subsequent chapters of the African Hybrid War research will then comprehensively examine the five separate categories of states and their pertinent neighbors that the author has already identified as being relevantly incorporated into the immediate thesis. To remind the reader about what was described in Part III of the book‚Äôs Introduction and to expand upon the earlier presented paradigmatic map in a more structurally detailed manner, the following cartographic revision will be henceforth used as the point of reference in guiding the research beyond Part I: 
Key 
* Yellow ‚Äì East Africa/East African Federation 
* Blue ‚Äì Central-Southern Africa 
* Black ‚Äì Failed State Belt 
* Red ‚Äì Lake Chad Region 
* Hashed/Thatched Lines ‚Äì countries that will inevitably become involved in the targeted category states‚Äô Hybrid War destabilization, whether as an aggressive actor, a passive victim, or a blended mix thereof. Schematic Observations 
A few comments need to be stated about the above map before commencing Part I of the African Hybrid War research: 
Southern African Cone: 
Firstly, while it‚Äôs conceptually possible for all states in Africa (or anywhere in the world, for that matter) to be afflicted by Hybrid War, keeping in accordance with the axiom that this method of warfare is more often than not applied in disrupting multipolar transnational connective infrastructure projects and/or seizing control of them, it can be surmised that the ones which could most radically revolutionize the continent‚Äôs geopolitical and geo-economic would be most actively targeted and consequently receive the highest likelihood of some sort of Hybrid War destabilization in the coming future. All of this will be described in detail in Part I, but for now it‚Äôs enough to know that the identified states lay along the paths of China‚Äôs presently constructed Silk Road routes or most probable forthcoming projects that it could pursue in achieving its grand strategic ends. 
It should be clarified at this point that the Southern African Cone was not included in the above model because its economic corridors are relatively well-established and have already been utilized for some time by all sorts of Great Powers, the West obviously included. Furthermore, concerning Namibia and Botswana‚Äôs global connectivity via South Africa, and to an extent, even Zimbabwe and Mozambique‚Äôs as well, this mostly deals with the one-way transport of natural resources and less so with each respective state‚Äôs labor and market potential. While each of these countries have a given role that they play vis-√†-vis the Chinese economy, none of them except for South Africa (the hub through which most of their exports, barring Mozambique‚Äôs, pass) is integral enough to be targeted by their own Hybrid War. 
Theoretically speaking, disruptions in the regional periphery around South Africa could have a strategic effect in putting pressure on the country‚Äôs multipolar leadership and pave the way for a regime change scenario, but given the rotten nature of corrupt South African politics, it‚Äôs more expected that traditional ‚Äòsoft coup‚Äô means such as constitutional technicalities and simple Color Revolutions (i.e. the anti-Rousseff coup in Brazil) would be used in this instance. Additionally, the resources of the population-sparse countries of Namibia and Botswana and the general market and labor potential of South Africa are already pretty much integrated into the larger global economy, so there are many existing unipolar stakeholders that would also be adversely affected by a severe disruption in or around their common point of African access. The same can‚Äôt be said so much about Zimbabwe and Mozambique, the former rich in minerals such as diamonds and platinum while the latter is poised to become one of the world‚Äôs largest LNG exporters, so it‚Äôs entirely possible that they may be targeted sometime in the future. But even so, it would be less in connection with China‚Äôs multipolar transnational connective infrastructure projects than with their own individual standalone potentials in their respective fields, thus strategically differentiating them from the other countries included in the present study (although that is not to say that Hybrid War techniques would not be used ‚Äì they probably would to a large extent). 
Insular Importance: 
In relation to the above, the insular countries of Africa were also not included in the continental overview, although they too play an important role in its evolving geopolitical paradigm. Nevertheless, because they‚Äôre island nations, they‚Äôre not directly connected to anything else besides the high seas, so although they may have valuable transit node status for China as an integral component of its Sea Lines of Communication, they‚Äôre not as directly affected by the region-stretching Hybrid War study that was commenced for the mainland. Nevertheless, because each of them could play a pivotal role in influencing continental affairs if properly utilized by a partnering Great Power, it‚Äôs worthwhile to very concisely comment on how they fit into the larger strategic equation that will be described throughout this work: 
* Yellow ‚Äì Canary Islands (Spain): This legacy holding allows Madrid to exert influence near the coasts of Morocco and Western Sahara, both thought to be rich with fish and possible energy resources. 
* Green ‚Äì Cabo Verde (formerly Cape Verde prior to late-2013): The former Portuguese colony connects the North and South Atlantic and offers a strategic position near the mouth of the Senegal River, as well as being positioned along an important oceanic route that the US and EU must take to access West Africa. 
* Blue ‚Äì S√£o Tom√© and Pr√≠ncipe: Another former Portuguese colony, this one is crucially located in the hydrocarbon-rich waters of the Gulf of Guinea and in close proximity to the shoreline of Africa‚Äôs largest economy, Nigeria. 
* Violet ‚Äì Comoros and the French overseas department of Mayotte: These two locations are almost on top of northern Mozambique‚Äôs LNG-prospected Rovuma Basin and thus near what will likely become a major energy exporting area in the near future. 
* Orange ‚Äì Seychelles: The former UK-colonized island chain lies along the route of approach that India and China must take in accessing the burgeoning East African marketplace, and it‚Äôs for this strategically competitive reason that New Delhi has proactively sought to build a naval base and position some of its military units there in order to ‚Äúcontain‚Äù China. 
* Unmarked ‚Äì Mauritius and the French island of Reunion: These two insular areas are not directly relevant to Africa‚Äôs mainland geopolitical order, although they do acquire significance vis-√†-vis Madagascar and the US-controlled Indian Ocean bastion of Diego Garcia. 
Transregional Conflict Overspill: 
One of the most striking aspects of the reference map is that it clearly delineates the geopolitical fault lines where Hybrid War conflicts could easily become transregional: 
Out of all of the areas designated by the map, it‚Äôs most probable that the uncontrollably violent processes in the Failed State Belt of the Central African Republic (CAR) and South Sudan would be the ones to spread to other parts of Africa, at least as regards the continent‚Äôs conflicts that are presently ongoing (and not accounting for those that have yet to possibly erupt). In particular, CAR‚Äôs chaos could result in a refugee and militant overspill to Cameroon and Chad, possibly leading to these respective Christian- and Muslim-led governments supporting their own confessional sides in the country‚Äôs unresolved civil war. The misleading ‚ÄúClash of Civilizations‚Äù narrative that would assuredly be purposely pushed by the Western mainstream media will be discussed later on when addressing the Failed State Belt, but at this moment it‚Äôs useful just to be aware of the transregional ‚Äúinfection‚Äù potential that the CAR has in affecting the Lake Chad region. Additionally, the country‚Äôs domestic difficulties could also spread southward into the northern reaches of the Central-Southern state of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), representing a dual destabilization threat emanating from the CAR. 
South Sudan can do something similar to the CAR in relation to the northern part of the DRC, but possibly even to the Horn of Africa state of Ethiopia and the East African state of Uganda as well. Tellingly, these latter two states are actively involved in the conflict resolution process in South Sudan and are jostling against one another for influence there in order to carve out defensive buffers (but also markets, of course) to protect themselves from this scenario. It should go without saying that South Sudan was only brought into existence because it was forcibly severed from Sudan proper over a three-decade-long civil war period, and the dynamic of anti-Khartoum action hasn‚Äôt stopped since Juba gained its independence in 2011. Therefore, South Sudan represents an even larger asymmetrical regional threat than CAR does, and their combined destabilization potential explains why they‚Äôre both categorized together as part of the Failed State Belt. 
If their respective conflicts somehow merged into a transnational conflagration, then that would represent a large-scale Hybrid War threat in the geographic heart of Africa, but the closest this has henceforth come has been the over-exaggerated threat of Joseph Kony. With reference to the Failed State Belt‚Äôs Hybrid War vulnerabilities and the transregionalization that its internal conflicts pose, it‚Äôs little wonder then that the US exploited the mystique around this warlord in order to deploy a limited but very strategic contingent of its special forces to Uganda, South Sudan, DRC, and CAR. Almost as an afterthought but drawing on the tangent of transregional conflict overlap, it‚Äôs topically pertinent to recall the Darfur Conflict and how this essentially was a proxy competition between the Lake Chad regional state of Chad and the extended Failed State Belt and somewhat Gulf-influenced state of Sudan. It‚Äôs no longer as relevant of a geopolitical item as it once was during the mid-2000s, but it nevertheless still has the potential to re-erupt in the future, especially if the externally directed Sudanese dissolution process speeds up and makes headway in the states of Blue Nile and South Kordofan. 
Lastly, there‚Äôs the realistic possibility that the US‚Äô attempts to instigate a Hybrid War in Burundi could set off a chain reaction of destabilization in the eastern DRC, Rwanda (and by extent, possibly up to Uganda), and western Tanzania, thereby making this geographically tiny state a disproportionately large trigger in upsetting the regional balance. Although there‚Äôs not yet an active conflict in Burundi anywhere on par with the scale of what‚Äôs been raging in the CAR and South Sudan over the past couple of years, this doesn‚Äôt mean that one can‚Äôt quickly develop if the entire state collapses under Hybrid War pressure, and this disturbing scenario will certainly be explored more at length later on in the work. 
Mapping out the expected transregional conflict overspill zones in Africa, one can unmistakably see that it‚Äôs the entire Upper-Central (Failed State Belt) and the eastern portion of the Central-Southern zones of Africa that are most at risk of this destructive process unfolding. Accordingly, this realization leads one to conclude that the DRC and the areas immediately abutting it provide the most fertile ground for the transnationalization of domestic conflicts, which somewhat (but not totally) explains why the Second Congo War eventually came to involve states located far away from the actual battlespace and be nicknamed ‚Äú Africa‚Äôs World War ‚Äù. To put it another way, the Hybrid War vulnerabilities of the identified area combined with its obvious geostrategic centrality to the African continent makes it doubly capable of sucking countless states into a literal Black Hole of Chaos that could easily become the ultimate proxy war climax between the US and China.

"Sure, ‚ÄúSaturday Night Live‚Äù has offered ample criticism of President Trump and his young administration. But in its latest episode, the program expressed confidence that he‚Äôll be in office until at least 2018, long enough to see America decimated by an alien invasion force from the planet Zorblatt 9. After a palpable absence last week, Alec Baldwin returned to play Mr. Trump in the ‚ÄúS. N. L. ‚Äù cold open, which imagined him in a future year, visiting a military base and trying to dispense words of inspiration while the United States battles with an extraterrestrial adversary. It was an opportunity for a rousing ‚ÄúIndependence Day‚Äù  speech. So how did he start? Mr. Baldwin  ‚Äî   who, outside of ‚ÄúS. N. L. ,‚Äù has recently been hinting that he does not plan to play Mr. Trump in perpetuity  ‚Äî   began by asking, ‚ÄúWho here loves Trump?‚Äù ‚ÄúI know this guy over here, he loves Trump,‚Äù he said, pointing at what turned out to be a charred corpse. A military officer played by the cast member Kenan Thompson told him, ‚ÄúThe aliens are killing us, sir. They have the most advanced weaponized technology we‚Äôve ever seen. What should we do?‚Äù The Trump character responded, ‚ÄúHere‚Äôs what we‚Äôre going to do. We are going to bring coal back, O. K.? We‚Äôre going to have so much coal, you‚Äôre going to say, ‚ÄòWhere did all this coal come from? I never knew there could be so much coal. ‚Äô‚Äù Informed that the aliens had already vaporized the state of California, Mr. Baldwin answered, ‚ÄúSo then I won the popular vote?‚Äù As Mr. Trump, he explained that the aliens had already been secretly living in the United States for hundreds of years. ‚ÄúLook, there‚Äôs one right there,‚Äù he said, indicating Leslie Jones. ‚ÄúAnd so is the woman next to her, right there,‚Äù he said, pointing at Sasheer Zamata. Asked where he was getting his information, Mr. Baldwin replied, ‚ÄúFrom a very reputable source, Infowars. It‚Äôs a radio show hosted by Alex Jones. You know he‚Äôs legit because he‚Äôs always taking off his shirt. ‚Äù When the aliens at last overrun the base and learn that Mr. Trump is president, one creature (played by Bobby Moynihan) declares, ‚ÄúReally? This is going to be so easy. ‚Äù A filmed segment shown later featured the guest host Scarlett Johansson as Ivanka Trump, in a commercial parody for her own brand of perfume. A narrator pitched the product in a whispery  : ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs Ivanka. And a woman like her deserves a fragrance all her own. A scent made just for her. Because she‚Äôs beautiful. She‚Äôs powerful. She‚Äôs complicit. ‚Äù The narrator added, ‚ÄúShe doesn‚Äôt crave the spotlight. But we see her. Oh, how we see her. ‚Äù (At the same time, Ms. Johansson was shown looking in a mirror and applying lipstick, seeing the reflection of Mr. Baldwin as Mr. Trump, performing the same action.) A final   for Complicit described it as ‚Äúthe fragrance for the woman who could stop all this, but won‚Äôt. ‚Äù (‚ÄúAlso available in a cologne for Jared,‚Äù the narrator said, in a reference to Ms. Trump‚Äôs husband, Jared Kushner.) During a   segment on ‚ÄúWeekend Update,‚Äù Kate McKinnon reprised her role as Attorney General Jeff Sessions, seated side by side with Senator Al Franken (Alex Moffat) the Minnesota Democrat and ‚ÄúS. N. L. ‚Äù alumnus who has said that Mr. Sessions may have perjured himself in his responses to Mr. Franken‚Äôs questions at his confirmation hearing. As Mr. Sessions, Ms. McKinnon said, ‚ÄúPeople don‚Äôt realize this, but Al and I are actually great friends. ‚Äù In the past, she said, she took him   rafting, and, in return, ‚ÄúAl showed me Jew stuff. ‚Äù (‚ÄúWe had lunch at a deli, Jeff,‚Äù Mr. Moffat replied in an imitation of Mr. Franken‚Äôs dry delivery.) Mr. Moffat tried to get Ms. McKinnon to clarify her testimony: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm just a simple country laaaaar,‚Äù she explained. ‚ÄúAre you saying lawyer or liar?‚Äù he asked. For good measure, ‚ÄúWeekend Update‚Äù concluded with Pete Davidson taking potshots at various people associated with the Trump administration, including the White House adviser Stephen Miller (‚ÄúHe tries to project strength,‚Äù Mr. Davidson said, ‚Äúbut he looks like Fredo Corleone had been even sicker as a child‚Äù) and Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the deputy White House press secretary (whom Mr. Davidson called ‚Äúone of those sweet Southern girls that you marry if you‚Äôre gay‚Äù). Last week, the president‚Äôs son Donald Trump Jr. responded playfully to his portrayal on ‚ÄúS. N.

"45 Weird Bans on Women in Iran Gender apartheid in the Islamic Republic. October 27, 2016 Dr. Majid Rafizadeh 
Under Iran‚Äôs Islamic laws, women are prohibited from performing basic day-to-day activities. I had firsthand experience of witnessing many of these strange and bizarre bans while living in Iran and other Muslim countries. Millions of women, including my relatives in Iran and Syria, continue to face these injustices. Some of the following rules, which are derived from Iran‚Äôs Islamic constitution and moral police codes, were recently reported on by Deutsche Welle Farsi . They exist in may other Islamic countries as well: 
1. Women are prohibited from taking selfies with soccer players. Specifically, Iran‚Äôs ‚Äúmoral committee‚Äù has banned women from taking selfies with famous soccer players. 
2. Iranian women are prohibited from riding bicycles. Iran‚Äôs Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, recently issued an Islamic fatwa regarding officially banning women from riding bicycles. He argued that ""riding bicycles often attracts the attention of men and exposes the society to corruption, and thus contravenes women's chastity, and it must be abandoned,‚Äù according to Iran‚Äôs state-run media. 
3. Coffee shops are prohibited from hiring women. According to Iran‚Äôs police, women are banned from working in any caf√©s. 
4. Iranian Muslim women cannot marry non-Muslim men. But Iranian Muslim men can marry non-Muslim women. 
5. It is forbidden for women to wear boots over their pants. (Why? I am not sure what is Iran‚Äôs Islamic logic behind this.) 
6. Women are not allowed to wear hats instead of veils to cover their hair. 
7. Women are not allowed to wear tight clothes that show their body curves. 
8. Women are prohibited from wearing tight clothes for swimming. 
9. Women are forbidden from changing their religion or criticizing Muhammad, Allah, the Supreme Leader and other Muslim leaders. 
10. Women are prohibited from entering sport stadiums and watching men‚Äôs sports. 
11. In Iran, buses and subways are divided in two sections. The larger front section is for men, the smaller back section is for women. Women are prohibited from entering the men's section even if there are no seats left in the back and there are plenty of empty seats in front of the bus. 
12. According to Iran‚Äôs moral police, women are banned from wearing leggings. 
13. Women are prohibited from showing strands of their hair on any side. Article 683 states: ‚ÄúThose women that appear in the streets and public places without the Islamic hijab, shall be sentenced from ten days to two months‚Äô imprisonment or fined from fifty thousand to five hundred thousand Rials.‚Äù 
14. Women are banned from going camping with men. 
15. Any kind of contraceptive surgery is not allowed for women. 
16. Women are banned from entering coffeehouses or smoking hookah. 
17. Women are not allowed to initiate divorce. Men have the right to do so. 
18. According to Iran‚Äôs family code, women cannot travel abroad except with the permission of their custodian or natural guardian (husband, father, etc.). They also cannot obtain a passport without the consent of their husbands. 
19. Women are banned from wearing clothes with writing on them. 
20. Women are banned from taking their hijab off in any sport event, including in the Olympics. 
21. Iranian women are prohibited from pursuing education in some academic fields. Iranian regime's oil minister argued that ‚Äúeducation of women in the field of operations such as drilling and processing and so on that require (physical) activities in operational areas and sites is useless and these are masculine (men‚Äôs) jobs.‚Äù 
22. Women are not allowed to work in any occupation if their husband disagrees with it. Article 1105 of the Civil Code states, ‚ÄúIn relations between husband and wife, the position of the head of the family exclusively belongs to the husband.‚Äù In addition, when it comes to employment laws, Article 1117 of the Civil Code indicates, ‚ÄúThe husband can prevent his wife from an occupation or technical profession which is incompatible with the family‚Äôs interests or the dignity of him or his wife.‚Äù 
23. Women are banned from receiving the same amount of inheritance as their male relatives. Even if a husband dies, the wife will receive only one-eighth of the inheritance if she has a child. 
24. Women are forbidden from having any physical contact with men, including shaking hands. 
25. Women are banned from becoming a Supreme Leader. 
26. Girls, as young as 9 years old, are not allowed to object to their parents decision to marry them off. 
27. Women are not allowed to object to their husband‚Äôs requests for sex. The law of Tamkin means women‚Äôs submission, obedience, full accessibility and unhampered sexual availability to her husband. Sexual availability is considered a woman‚Äôs duty and a man‚Äôs right. 
28. Women are not allowed to bring lawsuits if they are raped, unless they have four witnesses. 
29. Women are banned from socializing or dating men. 
30. Women are banned from attracting attention in public through ‚Äúflamboyant behavior‚Äù such as laughing loudly. 
31. Women are not allowed to show any part of their skin except the face. It is encouraged to cover the face as well. 
32. Women are not allowed to have any kind of alcoholic drinks. 
33. Women are not allowed to dance. 
34. Women are forbidden from being lesbian. Sex between two women is adultery and the punishments range from stoning to execution. 
35. Women are banned from listening to ‚Äúforbidden‚Äù music. 
36. Women are not allowed to have pets, such as a dog. 
37. Women are banned from adopting except if they have a husband and he agrees to do so. 
38. Women are prohibited from gambling in any kind of event. 
39. Women are banned from having sex or marrying a man up to five or six months after their divorce. 
40. Women are prohibited from having tattoos. 
41. Women are not allowed to have premarital relationships with men. 
42. In many of Iran‚Äôs provinces, women are banned from performing music on stage. 
43. Women are banned from being judges. 
44. Women are banned from striking their husband, but men are allowed to do so in some circumstances. 
45. Women are not allowed to show their jewelry in public. 
Some women continue to defy these rules, but many face severe punishment and discrimination for performing some of these normal day-to-day activities. We need to raise our voice in helping Muslim women in Iran and other Muslim countries who desire to experience freedom, social justice, equality, and do not want to be subjugated, dehumanized, treated as second class citizens, or solely as sexual toys for men.",Foregin,
Ludicrous...,Foregin,
"Leave a reply 
Mike Adams ‚Äì My fellow Americans, we are watching history unfold before us with such sound and fury that we are likely to never witness comparable events again in our lifetime. As of today, I am now convinced that the deep state has turned on Hillary Clinton and will unveil damning in the next few days that will end the Clintons‚Äô reign of terror over America and collapse her bid for the presidency. 
The mainstream media, of course, will never report this news for the simple reason that they are the propaganda arm of the criminal Clinton cartel. As such, they will lie to the public to the bitter end, even as the Clinton Titanic sinks with all of them on board (in deep, frigid waters, no less, with no more lifeboats to be found). 
The so-called ‚Äúdeep state‚Äù‚Äî the powerful insiders who really run the intelligence services and inner layers of untouchable bureaucracy ‚Äî has decided Hillary Clinton is too damaged to defend any longer . Even if she were to win by stealing the election, she would be so mired in criminal investigations and political illegitimacy that she would rip the nation to shreds while fighting for her own political survival. 
It has now been decided, I believe, that Hillary Clinton will be taken out of power by releasing criminally damaging emails which have long been held by the NSA and FBI. This will likely happen before the coming weekend. Once that is accomplished, the next goal will be to wait for President Trump to take office, then destroy the U.S. economy through a controlled, global debt collapse so that Trump can be blamed for the near collapse of western economies. (Remember: The deep state isn‚Äôt pro-Trump. They‚Äôre still all about defending the establishment. But Hillary is one bridge too far for even the statists to stomach‚Ä¶) 
Instead of allowing Hillary Clinton to take power and destroy America from the top, in other words, deep state power brokers have reverted to ‚ÄúPlan B‚Äù which is to let Trump take the White House, then destroy America through the controlled demolition of its currency and economy. This is simpler than it sounds. Bringing down the debt pyramid of a nation carrying nearly $20 trillion in national debt isn‚Äôt exactly rocket science. All they have to do is stand back and stop manipulating the markets and stop printing new money for a few months while raising interest rates. Monetary gravity will do the rest‚Ä¶ 
In the mean time, Hillary Clinton and a long list of her co-conspirators are going to find themselves charged with obstruction of justice , lying under oath, destruction of evidence, conspiracy, corruption and other serious charges that will lead to serious prison time for many. 
The criminal racket of the Clintons is about to implode. The participants will be charged under the RICO Act for ‚Äúracketeering‚Äù activities, for which ample evidence already exists. A new video from Steve Pieczenik describes some of this 
In this video, intelligence insider Steve Pieczenik lays out how high-level intelligence insiders are now working in concert to ‚Äúreverse the Clinton coup‚Äù that‚Äôs attempting to take over America and destroy it from within. 
Even if you don‚Äôt believe Pieczenik ‚Äî and I fully realize he‚Äôs controversial in his own way ‚Äî this short video is a very important ‚Äúmust watch‚Äù explanation to know what people in the intelligence community are doing‚Ä¶‚Äúwe‚Äôve initiated a counter-coup‚Ä¶‚Äù 
The Clintons are going to go ‚Äúfull murder‚Äù in a last ditch, desperate effort to save themselves 
Beware of what may yet unfold in the coming days. Like a cornered wild animal, the Clintons are extremely dangerous when they realize they have nothing to lose by going ‚Äúfull murder‚Äù in an attempt to save themselves. 
I will not be surprised the least bit if bodies of people in high places start piling up over the next week. Watch for news reports of mysterious car crashes, swimming pool accidents or ‚Äúnatural‚Äù deaths involving people like James Comey, who‚Äôd better have armed security personnel around him at all times. 
Look for desperate measures such as the Clintons attempting to blackmail Obama, Comey or anyone who they think might serve as leverage to save their own skins. We might also see desperate false flag attacks unfold in the next few days, although that‚Äôs increasingly unlikely since it seems the Clintons are now on their own (they would need the assistance of Obama to pull off another Sandy Hook, you see). A deal has already been struck with Obama 
Most likely, deep state operatives have already struck a deal with Obama to avoid prosecuting him for his own serious crimes as long as he stays out of the way as Hillary Clinton‚Äôs head is served up on a platter. This likely explains why Obama is now publicly saying he trusts Comey (and refuses to go to bat for Hillary). There‚Äôs no love lost between Obama and the Clintons (remember 2008?). 
As all this is going down, the propaganda ministry of the Clinton regime ‚Äî CNN, NYT, Washington Post, etc. ‚Äî is going to explode into an all-out ‚Äúbat-s##t crazy‚Äù conspiracy theory phase where they blame the Russians, extraterrestrials, Bigfoot and the Loch Ness Monster for everything that‚Äôs imploding around the Clintons. Mainstream media news reports are going to increasingly sound like sociopathic babble from crazy people grasping at whatever outlandish theories they can invoke. Maybe crop circles were created by the Russians as a secret code to Wikileaks and Donald Trump, eh? 
Meanwhile, conspiratorial operatives like George Stephanopoulos fully realize they are probably going to jail for collusion and sedition , so they have nothing left to lose by desperately trying to put Hillary in the White House via any means at their disposal, including totally faking negative news against Donald Trump (which is, of course, the entire news mission of CNN at this point, a disgraced propaganda network run by anti-American traitors). If the vote is stolen for Hillary Clinton, all hell breaks loose 
Should the globalist Soros operators manage to steal the vote, bribe the electoral voters or rig the black box voting machines sufficiently to place Hillary Clinton in the White House, all Hell breaks loose across America : ‚Ä¢ The FBI goes into full indictment mode to push criminal charges for the Clinton criminal regime. ‚Ä¢ Donald Trump launches a massive legal challenge to the election outcome, dispatching an army of lawyers to level a vast assortment of charges involving coordinated voter fraud, the rigging of voting machines, the attempted bribery of Electoral voters and so on. ‚Ä¢ The U.S. military revs up its plans for an armed military coup to depose Clinton and restore democracy. This one should be especially entertaining to watch unfold if it gets activated‚Ä¶ (and yes, YOU will beg for a short-term military dictatorship as long as they promise to depose Clinton and restore open, fair and free elections). ‚Ä¢ Armed U.S. citizens prepare for a massive march on Washington to take back their democracy and restore a lawful society where the political elite don‚Äôt get away with corruption, fraud and murder. Expect this march to be joined by police officers and federal law enforcement officials of all kinds. ‚Ä¢ The NSA likely goes into ‚Äúfull dump‚Äù mode to unleash every scrap of damning criminal evidence against Hillary Clinton. This will likely be joined by CIA assets who already have the goods on the Clintons and their ‚ÄúLolita Express‚Äù pedo joy rides. ‚Ä¢ Wikileaks, Anonymous and every former NSA analyst goes into ‚Äúdestroy the Clintons‚Äù mode and begins to hack and expose every last shred of email evidence ever possessed by the Clintons and anyone close to them. Anonymous alone has enough technical clout to accomplish this with little or no outside help. (I expect Kim Dotcom to be aiding this entire effort as well, as he rightly holds extreme hatred toward Hillary Clinton‚Ä¶ as do we all, come to think of it.) ‚Ä¢ The establishment Republicans in the U.S. Congress will, as usual, meekly surrender to the democrats, pulls down their britches and bend over to prepare to take it in the rear because that‚Äôs what they do best when the going gets tough. Totally useless politicrats like John McCain can‚Äôt get their pants around their ankles quickly enough when democrats start accusing them of something. These useless heaps of human baggage will be tossed out of Washington as the revolution unfolds, replaced with individuals who actually honor the U.S. Constitution (like Rep. Louie Gohmert). I root for all groups working to save America and expose the criminal politicians 
Bring out the marshmallows and weiners, folks: This is going to be the most bizarre campfire front row seat to U.S. history that anyone has witnessed in over 200 years. Try not to trip and ‚Äúface plant‚Äù into the flames as all this unfolds. It might be a smart idea to have some preparedness supplies at the ready, since no one really knows just how nasty this is all going to get. (And thank God Hillary doesn‚Äôt have her fingers on the nuclear launch codes, or she‚Äôd probably launch them just to change the narrative‚Ä¶) 
As for me, I‚Äôm with anybody who‚Äôs trying to save America , restore democracy and throw the establishment criminals in prison. Like almost everybody else, I‚Äôve had enough of the lies, the corruption, the media deceptions and the incessant blood sucking parasites in Washington D.C. who are too arrogant and stupid to realize just how much they‚Äôre universally despised. The revolution is ON. Anonymous, Wikileaks, Project Veritas, the FBI and the NSA have all been activated. There‚Äôs no stopping them now, and all the details of all the crimes of the Clintons are about to spill onto the stage of history, dirty deeds and all. 
Be warned, you are probably not psychologically prepared for the truth about what the Clintons really are. You will probably vomit. SF Source Natural News Nov. 2016 Share this:",Foregin,
"Region: USA in the World When countries are in trouble they always react the same way. If they have economic troubles their governments take ever greater control of the public finances, whether through austerity or centrally-dictated spending programmes. When there is civil strife the government calls out the army and restricts liberties to regain control of the situation. When wars are taking place elections are cancelled so the government of the day remains in power to deal with the conflict. These measures have the effect of entrenching the ‚ÄúEstablishment‚Äù, whoever that may be at a given time, and excluding others. People can only play a part in addressing the problems of the country at the whim of the Establishment, with appointments replacing elections in many such scenarios. Only when the Establishment is secure does it allow greater freedom of debate, action and participation, which are regarded as the hallmarks of stable countries . Now Donald Trump has been elected President of the United States on an avowedly anti-Establishment platform. He tapped into those disaffected by the political system and found the issues on which he could make the most noise. That in itself was a virtue with the constituency he was trying to attract. Too many people have become disaffected with politics everywhere because someone has decreed certain views to be unacceptable, without giving a reason why, and Trump was only too happy to give voice to those who have been told that their views don‚Äôt entitle them to one. But is Trump‚Äôs election the democratic revolution he claims? Does it actually give a voice to the voiceless and power to the powerless? In order to exercise any power President Trump will have to do all the things he accuses his opponents in the Establishment of, but worse. For a while he might get away with it, but he will never have the resources to win in the longer term. All we will have is the methods, with no returns: Establishment oppression on a scale beyond the worst nightmares of the enforced nobodies who now think they are somebody, but are in fact Donald Trump. Who do you think you are? As it turned out, Hillary Clinton failed to get past a problem she would not have had as a Republican. If you are on the conservative end of the political spectrum you are expected to act like you belong in power when you have it. People in more progressive parties claim to represent the interests of the broad mass of people who will never be rich and powerful. If they stay in power for too long, they create a distance between themselves and that mass which erodes their natural support. Hillary Clinton has been a national figure in the US for a generation. Her accession to the Democratic nomination was seen as almost dynastic, a factor which harmed Senator Edward Kennedy when he ran for the Democratic nomination against Jimmy Carter in 1980. She was referred to as the ‚ÄúEstablishment candidate‚Äù throughout the campaign, particularly by members of her own party who preferred socialist Bernie Sanders, who complained throughout the primary process that the voting was being rigged and that the media were falsely reporting that she had won the nomination before it was mathematically certain . For a Republican, all this would play well, except in extreme circumstances such as Watergate. For a Democrat it was bound to depress enthusiasm in the party‚Äôs voter base, and either drive it to another candidate or persuade it to stay at home, particularly when enough scandal attaches to Clinton as it is due to her business and government dealings. Clinton was about her nice office in Washington, not the problems of real Democrats. Keeping her there would have solved nothing. This was seen most clearly in Wisconsin, a traditional Democratic mainstay which voted for Trump despite the fact exit pollsters were showing that a large numbers of voters greatly disliked both he and Clinton . Many of those who disliked Trump still voted for him because they felt disliked themselves by politicians such as Clinton, who had let them down more than a newcomer had been able to do. He was ‚Äúthe-none-of-the-above‚Äù candidate from early on in the primary election period. Poacher turns gamekeeper Whether Trump would have got anywhere near the Republican nomination had there been a Republican president for the last eight years is unlikely. Only as an outsider could he gain any traction within a party which thinks of itself as the natural party of government, and would pick an insider every time to maintain its hold on power. The Republican Party will remain largely embarrassed by Trump, despite his victory. He may be the voters‚Äô idea of a president, but he isn‚Äôt what Republican politicians see as a Republican president. As the Huffington Post published underneath every article about Trump from January until election day, ‚ÄúDonald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar , rampant xenophobe , racist , misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims ‚Äì 1.6 billion members of an entire religion ‚Äì from entering the US.‚Äù Ask most Republican Congressmen, who control both houses, whether this describes a Republican President and you know what the answer will be, though Trump himself revels in such depictions. Well before the end of his term Trump will have become the Establishment himself. So to achieve anything in the checks and balances system the US has he will either have to carry the party and the military-industrial establishment with him, and become more embedded than Clinton is to do it, or try and purge the very many who will oppose him. Throughout his ‚Äúbusiness career‚Äù, if repeated bankruptcy, con, robbing of contractors and tax avoidance can be dignified with such a term, Trump has relied on bluster and a stubborn refusal to face reality to prosper. Whether he can get away with that with the military and intelligence staff who have ruined America‚Äôs global reputation with impunity is another matter. Presidents who spent lifetimes working the system have not been able to control the CIA or the industrial and media barons. If Trump tries, he will have to exert extreme control to do it, and become more exclusive than the Establishment itself. Jimmy Carter was elected in 1976 as an antidote to a corrupt political establishment. Despite his long years of public service, he was discarded four years later for being exactly what he was elected to be ‚Äì a good man out of his depth in murky Washington. Trump has never held any elected office. Is he going to take on those same forces and turn them into public servants? More than he can chew out 
One of Trump‚Äôs selling points with poorer Americans is that he pledged to stop US involvement in costly foreign wars. In particular, he said he could work with Russia and saw no need for the continual war rhetoric coming out of every Western government. Obviously this plays well with those who can‚Äôt afford to feed their families. The money will be spent on them, not bombs. But is it even possible to reduce the US military commitment, with so many bases, so many troops employed, so many weapons which will be manufactured and sold regardless? Trump may well find that the best way to stop foreign wars is to buy up all the weapons so that potential enemies don‚Äôt get them. The War on Terror would greatly diminish if the US didn‚Äôt supply arms to its favourite terrorists whilst pretending to fight them. But there is a vast industry devoted to maintaining armament and troop levels, which can only be justified by fighting wars against enemies real or imagined . So how would Trump go about achieving such a goal? Trump and his supporters are sons and daughters of the Bolsheviks. Convinced they are right, they think they can say what they like, do what they like and everyone else just has to put up with it because any opponent is part of the corrupt Establishment. It is no coincidence that Nigel Farage, former leader of UKIP and the main proponent of the UK leaving the European Union, has described Trump‚Äôs victory as a ‚Äú Supersized Brexit . Farage‚Äôs supporters behave the same way: everyone they don‚Äôt like hasn‚Äôt got the right to an opinion anymore, because they lost, and were inherently bad to begin with. Based on all we have seen so far, if someone stands in the way of Trump‚Äôs ambitions as president they will be told that they are holdovers from a corrupt system, serving masters who are now enemies of the people, and must therefore be removed. In order to get rid of them he would have to use extralegal measures in many cases, and deny them an opinion or another job. The ‚Äúpeople‚Äù Trump would be referring to are the dispossessed whose votes he courted, who by definition don‚Äôt have levers of power of their own. It hardly gives those people more power to demonise certain individuals on presidential say-so, but that is all Trump has offered so far, or may ever be capable of offering. Trump has enjoyed spreading hatred of various minority groups. As many commentators have pointed out, he has broken all the usual rules of presidential candidate conduct and got away with it. But this simply makes anyone a potential victim, and encourages such behaviour to go on unchecked. A system which was there long before a here-today-gone-tomorrow politician has all the levers his supporters don‚Äôt to maintain itself. But if attacked, it will have no alternative but to fight fire with fire. A battle for control fought behind the scenes would empower Trump‚Äôs supporters even less, whilst not addressing the specific problems which made them see Trump as the solution. Not beating them, only joining them This presidential election campaign was the ugliest within living memory. This played into Trump‚Äôs hands: it brought those who were told they couldn‚Äôt behave like that into the mainstream, and Trump as the outsider reaped the benefit. But it also created the expectation that this will be followed through: if you start such a process, you are expected to finish it. A poll taken just before Election Day showed that if Bernie Sanders had been running against Clinton and Trump he would have won by a landslide . Sanders supporters remain angry that he was denied the nomination by what they thought was an establishment fraud. Now Clinton has lost, they will make further efforts to ensure that anyone with Clinton credentials is neutralised so that they can present a more credible candidate in 2020, and will have much moral weight and grassroots sympathy behind this effort. As Clinton supporters will fight back in the same terms, the Democratic Party is likely to spend the next four years fighting itself rather than Trump, trying to exclude its own members in the same way Trump supporters want to get rid of everyone they don‚Äôt like. The Republicans have the same problem. Trump was as offensive to his intra-party opponents as he was to Clinton. Those who think themselves ‚Äúreal‚Äù Republicans will be emboldened by the pro-Sanders Democrats to seek to reclaim the party and its voters from the Trump constituency in the same way. This will generate more exclusion and counter-exclusion, even through Republican Congress versus Republican President battles, with each trying to show themselves to the public as More Republican Than Thou. Both Trump and Sanders supporters will now feel that they are the new ‚ÄúEstablishment‚Äù because they have been backed by their respective publics to overthrow the old one. Though both Trump and Sanders were the none-of-the-above candidates, they will be the above from now on. To justify their initial behaviour, and satisfy their support, they will have to be even worse Establishments than the ones they have removed, more intolerant, more exclusive ‚Ä¶more arbitrary. If the old guard is going to come back, they will have no choice but to adopt the same tactics. The choice at the next election will be between groups of battle-hardened intolerants who are more interested in serving their friends and stuffing their enemies than in the disaffected people in their midst. Trump has not overthrown the failed political Establishment and methods which created the disaffection he has exploited, he has confirmed their validity. Trump may change the personnel, but the Establishment will be the same animal, all the more dangerous for its delusions to the contrary.

"HONG KONG  ‚Äî   For Asia, the bad news this week was not that Donald J. Trump detailed a   plan to toughen American trade policy, especially toward China. It was that Hillary Clinton‚Äôs campaign accused Mr. Trump a few hours later of purloining her ideas, noting that she favored similar action on those issues. A strong dose of economic populism, with an occasional sprinkling of geopolitics, has suffused the trade plans of the leading American presidential candidates this year. Vying for votes, Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton are each promising to do more to preserve American jobs at a time of slowing global economic growth. And China  ‚Äî   with its vast trade, rising international influence and authoritarian government  ‚Äî   is a natural target. Presidential candidates vow every four years to do more to help American workers facing competition from abroad. After taking office, they have consistently pursued more conciliatory trade policies toward China, seeing a strategic benefit to warm relations with Beijing. But broad political distress this year over the loss of   working class jobs to global competition, coupled with mounting concern about China‚Äôs increasingly assertive military posture, suggest that the next president could actually follow through on the pledges. If they do, the policies could pose a real predicament for China, and for other Asian countries that depend on its economy. Millions of jobs in China and across the region require the continued willingness of the United States to rely overwhelmingly on imports to supply American families with everything from the clothes they wear to the smartphones they carry. Rapid economic growth in China and the development of a strong consumer market had seemed to reduce the country‚Äôs need for huge exports to the American market. But China‚Äôs economy has recently slowed, hurting domestic players from small exporters to large steel makers. Weaker growth at home has made it all the more important for China to maintain a large trade surplus with the United States, selling more to consumers and businesses there than it buys. For years, China has exported four times as much to the United States as it imports, and it continues to do so. ‚ÄúIf there are tougher trade policies from the United States,‚Äù said Shen Jianguang, an economist at Mizuho Securities Asia, ‚Äúthat will dampen Chinese exports. ‚Äù The candidates plan to take direct aim at the two countries‚Äô trade gap. They want to label China as a currency manipulator that undervalues the renminbi to help its exporters win sales in overseas markets. They want to file more trade cases against China and impose more tariffs. They want to investigate how the Chinese government subsidizes businesses. They also want to rethink big trade deals. Mr. Trump wants to scrap the   Partnership, a   agreement between the United States and a group of countries, mostly in Asia. Mrs. Clinton‚Äôs campaign took a subtly different position, saying that she opposed the agreement in its current form. The Asian countries involved in the trade pact, notably Vietnam and Japan, made significant concessions to American negotiators because they felt threatened by China‚Äôs rise. Now, the presidential candidates are lumping them together with China, holding them responsible for killing American jobs. With few exceptions, Chinese officials have tried to steer clear of commenting on the American candidates. Even Chinese academics, the usual pipeline to Beijing‚Äôs thinking, have been wary of doing so, to avoid being accused of violating China‚Äôs policy of not interfering publicly in other countries‚Äô politics. To the extent that Chinese experts say anything, it is to express hope that this year‚Äôs talk of getting tough on trade will not be a harbinger of policy shifts ahead. ‚ÄúThere is no big difference from previous presidential campaigns, only more emphasis, due to the poor world trade performances‚Äù and weak global economic prospects, said He Weiwen, a   of the  . S. . U. Study Center at the China Association of International Trade in Beijing. The uncertainty for China, and much of Asia, is whether the candidates will sing the same trade tunes once in office. Mr. Trump‚Äôs confrontational approach would seem to indicate some  . Mrs. Clinton seems less likely to change American policies, given that she supported President Obama‚Äôs free trade efforts during his first term of office, when she was secretary of state. Former Presidents Bill Clinton and George W. Bush, and Mr. Obama, at least initially, all tried to help China become more involved in the world economy. They hoped that more enmeshed trade and financial relationships would mean a more democratic China with closer diplomatic ties to the West. It seemed to work for a while. But in the last three years, China, under President Xi Jinping, has shifted toward more authoritarian rule. China has embarked on a   military buildup, constructed artificial islands with   runways in the South China Sea and challenged Japan‚Äôs control of a cluster of islands north of Taiwan. And a combination of strict censorship and comprehensive propaganda has fanned the already strong nationalism of the Chinese public. Those geopolitics have left American policy makers with two choices, neither of them appetizing. Further trade with China and additional investments there by Western multinationals could strengthen the Chinese economy and help Beijing afford even more ambitious territorial and military policies. Discouraging trade and investment could cause lower economic growth that might slow China‚Äôs military rise but also might feed   sentiment and foster public demands for more assertive foreign policy. If the candidates‚Äô ideas became policy, China would almost certainly retaliate in some fashion. American exports, while sharply smaller than those China sends in the other direction, are a potential focus. Beijing has proved especially adept in the past at targeting American exports from swing states in presidential elections and closely fought congressional districts, maximizing its leverage in the political process even if the economic effects were limited. The biggest immediate casualty of tougher trade policies could be the Obama administration‚Äôs effort to strengthen relations with countries like Japan, Singapore and Vietnam as a way to balance China‚Äôs growing muscle in East Asia. The economic centerpiece of the administration‚Äôs   pivot to Asia has been the negotiation of the   Partnership. That agreement calls for dismantling barriers to American trade with many of the countries that find themselves increasingly uneasy about China‚Äôs growing dominance. Mr. Trump denounced the pact again on Tuesday, saying that it would force American workers to compete with   Vietnamese workers. Mrs. Clinton, after supporting the early negotiations as secretary of state, has come out against the pact since the fall, saying that the deal does not go far enough to address issues like currency manipulation. Yet canceling the trade pact could actually cause more problems, by pushing American allies in the region into China‚Äôs arms and preventing American companies from developing in emerging Asian markets. ‚ÄúIf America kills the T. P. P. ,‚Äù said Kishore Mahbubani, the dean of the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy in Singapore, ‚Äúthen China becomes the main center of economic gravity. ‚Äù",Foregin,
"First things first: ‚ÄúThe Secret Life of Pets‚Äù is preceded by a short film starring the Minions, in which those irrepressible yellow gelcaps take up landscaping so they can purchase a blender. You may regard this extra little cartoon as a bonus or a tax, depending on your level of Minion tolerance. Mine reached its end around 90 seconds before the movie did. But in any case, Illumination Entertainment and Universal Pictures are determined to keep selling toys and Halloween costumes, and it‚Äôs pointless to protest the merchandising of manufactured cuteness. Part of the Minions‚Äô ostensibly universal charm lies in the fact that they speak no known language, but rather a chirpy, vaguely   patois. ‚ÄúThe Secret Life of Pets,‚Äù Illumination‚Äôs newest feature, relies on the more conventional sound of celebrity voices, mostly belonging to people who are professionally funny on television. Children may not be all that familiar with many of them, including Louis C. K. who plays the main character, a dog named Max. Louis C. K. on his television projects and in his   tends to work on the blue end of the spectrum, trafficking in melancholy as well as profanity. His presence here may be a gift to his own children, and to their college funds. It might also provide a measure of consolation to gloomy, sensitive   dads who need to sense a kindred soul on the other side of the screen. Similarly, Hannibal Buress (a dachshund) Jenny Slate (a fuzzy white lap dog whose exact breed I could not identify) and Lake Bell (a cat) might be here not because kids will recognize them from ‚ÄúBroad City‚Äù or ‚ÄúObvious Child‚Äù or ‚ÄúIn a World‚Äù but because youngish parents might want to feel a little bit cool at the multiplex on a Saturday afternoon. No shame in that! Fans of ‚ÄúModern Family‚Äù will be happy to hear Eric Stonestreet as a big furry dog. Fans of Kevin Hart who want more after ‚ÄúCentral Intelligence‚Äù and ‚ÄúRide Along 2‚Äù will enjoy his impersonation of an angry bunny. Albert Brooks is a grumpy raptor. That sentence was a pleasure to write. There is also a guinea pig, some other birds, lizards and even a few human beings. But this is mostly a dog story, full of capers and complications arising from the arrival of Duke (the big shaggy one voiced by Mr. Stonestreet) into the household Max shares with Katie (Ellie Kemper) his millennial owner. There is rivalry and resentment and eventually friendship. ‚ÄúThe Secret Life of Pets,‚Äù written by Cinco Paul, Ken Daurio and Brian Lynch and directed by Yarrow Cheney and Chris Renaud, is like one of those picture books about how to deal with a new baby, but with talking animals. Which is, all in all, pretty good fun.   cartoons generally are, if they have even a modest quantity of wit or   insight. And while this movie never achieves  ‚Äî   and does not really aim for  ‚Äî   the emotional richness or visual inventiveness of the better Pixar features, or the sly social consciousness of ‚ÄúZootopia,‚Äù it has a playful absurdity and a winning, friendly spirit. As the title suggests, the conceit is that when we humans are away, our furry, scaly, feathered companions get up to all kinds of mischief. They visit one another‚Äôs apartments, they dance and flirt and play loud music and then, when we return, pretend that they‚Äôve been waiting for us the whole time. Except for the cats, of course, who make a great show of not caring. Here I should say that, while Ms. Bell‚Äôs purring vocalizations are beyond reproach, the film is clearly the work of dog people, and traffics  ‚Äî   like nearly every other movie in its genre  ‚Äî   in some tired   stereotypes. I could go on about this, but I‚Äôm not supposed to let my political opinions affect my reviews. And I‚Äôm not biased. Dogs are fine. I have shared my home and opened my heart to a few of them. But they‚Äôre also just too easy, with their wet noses and broad pink tongues and eagerness to please. Cats are demanding. Complex. A more daring movie would have ventured beyond fat, pampered house cats and scrawny alley predators in its depiction of them. Representation matters. Speaking of politics, the house pets encounter an underground militant organization led by Mr. Hart‚Äôs adorably fuzzy, implacable little rabbit. He steals the movie, of course, and helps it ascend to a level of anarchic delight. The animated action is bouncy and frenetic, and if the story becomes a little too busy, it moves quickly and makes room for a barrage of jokes and even some character development. Ms. Slate‚Äôs Gidget the lap dog evolves from a lovestruck princess (pining for Max) into a fierce and resourceful action heroine. Max himself grows less  . Everyone gets home safely. Like the ‚ÄúDespicable Me‚Äù movies, which put Illumination on the map (and spawned those furshlugginer Minions) ‚ÄúThe Secret Life of Pets‚Äù is adequate animated entertainment, amusing while it lasts but not especially memorable except as a catalog of compromises and missed opportunities. Among those are the New York setting, a potential wonderland of glamour, filth and imagination that is rendered as blandly as if the movie had been shot on a   set. ‚ÄúThe Secret Life of Pets‚Äù is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested). Fewer poop jokes than you might expect.  Running time: 1 hour 26 minutes.",Foregin,

"First case of demonetisation-related HIV after man has unprotected sex with an ATM machine Posted on Tweet 
10th day into demonetisation and things are going from bad to worse. There is mayhem everywhere. We have already had reports of suicides, murders, robberies, cyclones, earthquakes, and Rohit Sharma‚Äôs ouster from Indian squad because of demonetisation, and now we have the first case of HIV that this dreadful ban has caused. 
The incident happened when a man contracted the disease from an already infected ATM machine in Mumbai. Despite numerous warnings issued by India Today and other media houses about ATM keypads transmitting the virus, he went to an ATM and touched the dangerous keypad. He was later diagnosed with HIV positive. 
‚ÄúSo did he actually have sex with the machine?‚Äù we asked an insider from India Today. 
‚ÄúNo, but withdrawing cash is as good as having sex with the machine. You have more or less the same feeling when you get the cash in your hand,‚Äù he affirmed. 
‚ÄúOk that‚Äôs interesting. So the engineering students are not virgins anymore and they can proudly brag about their sex lives.‚Äù 
‚ÄúWell, technically speaking, yes, they can.‚Äù 
‚ÄúSo, who is at risk of catching the virus? Someone with a poor immune system?‚Äù 
‚ÄúNo, anyone who is withdrawing cash from an ATM.‚Äù 
‚ÄúYou mean, balance inquiries and other transactions are safe, right?‚Äù 
‚ÄúWho stands in the queue for 3 hours to check balance?‚Äù 
‚ÄúOh ok, you are talking about the current scenario.‚Äù 
‚ÄúYes, people should avoid an ATM machine at any cost because it may cause STD as our researcher suggested, and once you are infected with an STD, you become more susceptible to HIV infection.‚Äù 
‚ÄúAnd who is the researcher at India Today you are referring to? Is it Rajdeep Sardesai?‚Äù 
‚ÄúNo, he is in Goa. The person who published the report is Jane Carlton.‚Äù 
‚ÄúOk but the report was published in 2014. Why are you linking it to currency ban?‚Äù 
‚ÄúBecause it‚Äôs always relevant.‚Äù 
‚ÄúBut what made you search the report two years after it was published and exactly at a time when people are desperately trying to use ATMs? We are just curious, what was going through your mind when you decided to look it up and what were the keywords you entered into Google that returned this report?‚Äù 
‚ÄúListen, I think I am done with the interview. If you have more questions then ask Rajdeep Sardesai. I am going to call him. Here are your boxing gloves.‚Äù 
‚ÄúBut you said he is in Goa,‚Äù we hurriedly wrapped-up the interview.",Foregin,

"We Are Change 

By David Armiak and Mary Bottari 
The Koch network has mobilized in South Dakota to defeat the ‚Äú South Dakota Accountability and Anti-Corruption Act ,‚Äù a state-wide initiative on the ballot November 8.
The anti-corruption measure, Initiated Measure 22 or IM-22, was launched by a bipartisan group called the South Dakotans for Integrity and put on the ballot with signatures from over 20,000 state residents.
IM-22 cracks down on dark money and phony industry front groups by barring candidate coordination with outside groups and regulating independent expenditures. It cracks down on sham ‚Äúissue ads,‚Äù which are really the functional equivalent of express advocacy, by requiring them to be reported electronically within 48 hours, requiring donor disclosure and requiring the top five donors to be disclosed on air. The initiative also provides a small dollar public financing mechanism, sets rules for lobbyists and gifts and creates an ethics commission to investigate violations of ethics and campaign finance rules.
The measure is one of four on ballot nationwide that seek to increase transparency in the financing of elections in a post-Citizens United world. In 2010, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in Citizens United v. FEC to strike down limits on ‚Äúindependent‚Äù political spending, which opened the floodgates for billions in dark money into elections nationwide.
If passed, South Dakota voters may finally have some way of knowing who is bankrolling those big money ads and before the election too.
Koch‚Äôs Americans for Prosperity Behind ‚ÄúDefeat 22‚Äù Group The Kochs are bankrolling the group working to defeat the initiative.
According to its statement of organization filing , Defeat22.com was founded by Ben Lee, the state director for the Koch‚Äôs astroturf group Americans for Prosperity , on July 1, 2016. The group promotes itself as a coalition, listing its 18 ‚Äúpartners‚Äù on its website including AFP, the South Dakota Chamber of Commerce & Industry, and the different GOP organizations, among others. But, a campaign disclosure filed on Friday with the South Dakota Secretary of State tells another story.
Of the $609,110 raised by Defeat22.com so far, $590,000 came from AFP. The next largest contribution of $1,500 from the SD Farm Bureau Federation was even dwarfed by AFP‚Äôs total in-kind contributions of $36,756 .
The opposition to IM-22 is led and organized by AFP. Chad Krier, AFP‚Äôs South Dakota Field Director, who has organized many of the campaign events to answer questions and solicit volunteers. AFP also appears to have tapped into its staff network to not only phone bank, but also go door to door to urge voters to Vote No on IM-22. Defeat22.com has send out mailings , placed radio ads , and put up billboards .
The Kochs are battling the measure because ‚Äúthe Kochs see IM-22 as a threat to the dominance the millionaires and billionaires have under the [current] political system,‚Äù says former Republican State Senator and co-chair of South Dakotans for Integrity Don Frankenfeld. The Kochs have been battling weaker donor disclosure laws in California in court for years.
And Koch allies in other states are lending a hand.
A right-wing Floridan think tank has been helping out the Defeat IM-22 forces. The Foundation for Government Accountability (FGA) has set up an ‚Äúeducational‚Äù website, Measure22.org , where it published poll results from 478 South Dakotans that demonstrates opposition to the measure in the state. The website operates under the name FGA Action, Inc., a 501(c)(04) that shares an address with FGA and lists its contact as Jonathan Bechtle , the COO and General Counsel at FGA.
The site also hosts two videos which are unsupportive of the measure, one produced by FGA Action, Inc. and another by UnitedforPrivacy.com. UnitedforPrivacy.com is the website for People United for Privacy, an SPN backed group that states , ‚ÄúTo change our laws to subject people to the chilling effects of having their privacy invaded and their personal information compiled in government databases and Google searches is not they way our democracy should operate.‚Äù
FGA is a member of the State Policy Network (SPN) , a right-wing web of ‚Äúthink tanks‚Äù in 48 states, which has been working hard to convince the public that the ‚Äúfree speech‚Äù rights of millionaires and billionaires are harmed by campaign finance disclosure laws. Both SPN and FGA are largely funded by the Donors Capital and Donors Trust investment vehicles utilized by the Koch network.
The amount of money spent by FGA Action, Inc. and People United for Privacy against IM-22 is unknown because both groups have yet to file disclosures.
The Kochs Protest ‚ÄúTaxpayer Funded Elections‚Äù The Kochs are attacking the anti-corruption measure for its creation of a small dollar publicly funded campaign finance system, which will give each registered voter two $50 vouchers that she can contribute to the candidate of her choosing if the candidate agrees to only fundraise from small donor South Dakotans. AFP argues in its Defeat22.com radio ad and mailings that this system will ‚Äúdivert‚Äù public tax dollars from roads and schools‚Äìan interesting line of attack from the anti-government Kochs which have opposed taxes for roads in states like Wisconsin.
In state, the Kochs protest ‚Äútaxpayer funded elections.‚Äù ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt let politicians take your tax dollars to fund their campaigns‚Äù is the Koch spin. Their preference is to put millionaires and billionaires in charge of campaigns and elections.
Nationally, Ben Lee is taking a different approach. In a recent opinion piece in Forbes , Lee trots out the Koch line that the ballot measure is a ‚Äúfull-on assault on the First Amendment cloaked in the guise of transparency.‚Äù The Kochs might believe that their right to bankroll politicians secretly is written into the constitution, but super majorities of average citizens‚Äìboth Democrats and Republican‚Äîdisagree and the popularity of campaign finance transparency and limits continues to rise .
The widespread support for IM-22 is best demonstrated by South Dakotans for Integrity‚Äôs financial disclosure submitted on Friday with attachments that list over 6,000 donations for a total of over $1.2 million. More than 99% of contributions were for $100 or less. The good government advocacy organization Represent Us provided $55,079 in in-kind contributions to South Dakotans for Integrity.
If IM-22 passes on November, it will put the brakes on secret political spending by AFP, the Kochs, and others pulling the strings in South Dakota. But, more significantly, if the law succeeds in setting up a campaign finance system that is more responsive to all citizens, not just the wealthy, it could become a model for other states to follow.
And this is precisely what the Kochs fear.
Two other two ballot measures promoting transparency and clean elections are Proposition 59 in California and Amendment 2 in Missouri.

"November 22, 2016 -  Deena Stryker, Katehon -  


In 1944, against a groundswell of concern for the democratic process, FDR ran and won a fourth presidential term, because Americans did not want an untried leader in the midst of two wars. (Unfortunately, Roosevelt died soon after that election, leaving President Truman to formulate the disastrous American policy toward the Soviet Union that brought us Cold Wars I and II.) 
Today, FDR‚Äôs presidency would probably be considered ‚Äòauthoritarian‚Äô: he pretended not to see Japan preparing to attack Pearl Harbor, so that shocked Americans would finally be willing to declare war on both Japan and Germany. He is famous for packing the Supreme Court, and although they were milder than would have wanted the Progressive Movement, he wrung workers‚Äô rights and protections out of Congress by signaling to his advisors ‚ÄúMake me do it.‚Äù He is still revered today, while one of the polities that ranks highest on key governance criteria is Singapore, a tiny, multi-ethnic country led by the same man for four decades. 
After achieving independence from Great Britain, Lee Kuan Yew moved Singapore‚Äôs Third World economy to First World affluence in a single generation. According to Wikileaks: ‚ÄúLee Kuan Yew's emphasis on rapid economic growth, support for business entrepreneurship, and limitations on internal democracy shaped Singapore's policies for the next half-century. Freedom House ranks Singapore as ""partly free‚Äù and The Economist ranks it as a ""flawed democracy"", however the ruling party gets 83 of 89 seats with 70% of the popular vote, while in the mid-eighties, Gallup reported Singaporeans‚Äô confidence in the government and judicial system among the highest in the world. 
Although Singapore ranks among the top countries for ""order and security"", ""absence of corruption"", and ""effective criminal justice,‚Äù gatherings of five or more people require police permits, and protests may legally be held only at the Speakers' Corner. Yet, this multi-lingual (English, Chinese and Hindu), country is among the top internationally in education and government supported health care. Although the system can only be classified as authoritarian, there is absolutely zero chance that a US president will declare that its leader ‚Äúhas to go‚Äù. That is because like Europe, it combines entre-preneurship with socialist citizen protections. 
Today, ‚Äôauthoritarianism‚Äô is applied equally to the Saudi Arabian monarchy, where women are not allowed to drive, much less legislate, to China, where the Communist Party watches over the biggest ever economic miracle, and to Russian president Vladimir Putin. Interestingly, it was not applied to Dmitri Medvedev when he was President (Vladimir Putin serving as his Prime Minister). Medvedev was referred to as ‚Äòa man we can work with‚Äô ‚Äîand even as ‚ÄôOur man in the Kremlin‚Äô. 
At home, however, his ‚ÄòAtlanticist‚Äô, neo-liberal faction is referred to by Putin supporters, who cherish their social protections and believe the state should be in charge of a nation‚Äôs key sources of wealth, as a ‚Äòfifth column‚Äô. 
What was the state of Russia when Vladimir Putin succeeded Boris Yeltsin, America‚Äôs first ‚Äòman in the Kremlin‚Äô? 
Putin first won election in 2000, three months after Yeltsin‚Äôs resignation for ill health. At forty-eight, thanks to his steadfastness as a KGB officer, then as advisor on international affairs to the mayor of St Petersburg, as head of the KGB, then Prime Minister to Boris Yeltsin (a president famous for his drunken displays), Putin was his designated successor at a time when Russia was in a shambles. 
Its crown jewels had been privatized at rock bottom prices to a group of men who became known as ‚Äòthe oligarchs‚Äô. State employees weren‚Äôt getting their paychecks on time ‚Äî if at all ‚Äî and virtually nothing had been done to build a fair liberal ‚Äîor social democratic ‚Äî system ten years after the dissolution of the Soviet Union. (When Vladimir Putin declared that this event had been a catastrophe, he was not, as the Western press implies, alluding to the demise of Communism, but to the terrible social conditions in which rabid privatization left most Russians.) 
Putin is invariably tagged as a ‚Äòformer KGB officer‚Äô by US journalists, who conveniently forget that the first President Bush ran the CIA for a year. The truth is that the Russian president‚Äôs wide-ranging jobs prepared him well for the challenge of reviving the largest country in the world, home to 160 ethnic groups speaking some 100 languages and practicing four different religions, Christianity, Judaism, Buddhism and Islam‚Äî(estimates for this latter ranging from 5 - 14%). 
The Western media claims that President Putin‚Äôs 80%+ ratings reflect a herd mentality, the result of centuries of autocratic rule under the Mongols (four centuries), the Tsars and the Communist Party. In reality, unbeknownst to most Americans, today‚Äôs Russians enjoy individualist lifestyles, vacations abroad and the latest cars. 
For twenty centuries, the lure of Athenian democracy (in which only free males participated) increased in tandem with the power of Kings. But applying democracy has proved ever more difficult as populations and threats grew larger. As he prepares to leave office after eight years of Republican refusal to cooperate with his laudable projects, I suspect President Obama, like most other Western heads of state, secretly envies Putin his ability to get things done. 
When I was in Cuba in 1964, Fidel Castro was being billed in the US as a dictator. I asked then president Osvaldo Dorticos whether or not he agreed that it was risky to have a ‚Äòking‚Äô, since one could never know whether inherited leadership would be good or bad. (The outside world did not know that the Cuban government was already experimenting with various forms of local democracy.) Today around the world, ‚Äòthe people‚Äô are still impotent to prevent worsening economic conditions ‚Äî and even war, which first fills the coffers of arms makers, then of industry, needed to rebuild what war has destroyed. Yet Raul Castro has overseen a transition toward a form of national participatory democracy, and Putin appears to be encouraging the same approach in Russia. Meanwhile, in the West it becomes increasingly difficult to affirm that free and fair elections guarantee efficient government or popular satisfaction. 
In the complex 21st century world, peace and prosperity are probably best achieved when strong central governments jointly deal with global challenges, while participatory local governments oversee domestic affairs. (Iceland, a country so sparsely populated that almost everyone knows everyone else, is successfully applying this system.) 

Although he has been elected ‚Äòfair and square‚Äô, Donald Trump may not make it into the White House, whence he, together with Putin and Xi could move toward a multi-polar world organized along those lines. Guided by ‚Äòan invisible hand‚Äô, thousands of people protest the neo-fascist, misogynist, racist president who defeated his neo-fascist rival preparing for nuclear-war against Russia, and whose backers, unlike the protesters, have the means to once again implement the ‚Äòultimate solution‚Äô against an American president.

"Swedish writer √Ösa Linderborg has claimed the Swedish economy would collapse if it was not for illegal migrants who she says are vital to the economy. [Ms. Linderborg, who serves as the cultural editor for Swedish newspaper Aftonbladet, wrote an opinion piece on Monday: ‚ÄúYes, there is a problem with those who are denied their asylum applications and then go underground,‚Äù but added: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs equally true that Sweden would stop working if the tens of thousands of undocumented migrants who are here vanished for real. ‚Äù  Linderborg made the argument that illegal migrants do the jobs that Swedes refuse to do saying illegals were the ones who worked   jobs like cleaning and in the service industry. The piece comes as a reaction to the news the terrorist in the Stockholm attack was a failed asylum seeker set to be deported. Following the attack, Prime Minister Stefan L√∂fven said that Sweden would no longer employ an open door policy for illegal migrants.  Though Linderborg claimed the Swedish economy relies solely on migrants, various reports have shown the opposite is true and that migrants are often the most likely to be unemployed in the country. A report from December 2015 predicted that six out of every 10 unemployed people in Sweden would come from a foreign background by 2017.  In October 2016, the employment numbers for Swedes were so high that some economists considered Swedes to have full employment. People from migrant backgrounds were almost opposite with some 21. 6 per cent being unemployed.    Of the 163, 000 migrants that Sweden took in during the migrant crisis in late 2015, fewer than 500 had found jobs as of June 2016.      Linderborg claims Sweden is ‚Äúexploiting‚Äù the migrants who do work because many of them are low skilled and are paid low wages. She then called on the prime minister to invest in migrants to improve their job prospects. The daughter of a former member of the Left Party, Linderborg was also a member of the Left Party and a member of the ‚ÄúCommunist Youth‚Äù during the 1980s.  Sweden is not the only country to have issues with migrants and unemployment. In Germany, economists have said the idea that migrants will become the skilled workers of tomorrow is an illusion and that mass migration will ultimately hurt economic growth in the long term.

"MONTICELLO, Iowa  ‚Äî   The Table of Knowledge was delving into   Donald J. Trump‚Äôs plans to upend government, and marveling at how he had forced his fellow Republicans in the House to reverse themselves on gutting the Office of Congressional Ethics. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs getting responses things are happening,‚Äù Jerry Retzlaff, a retiree, said. ‚ÄúHe got Congress to turn themselves around with one tweet. ‚Äù ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no secret the press doesn‚Äôt like him, and neither does a lot of the leadership,‚Äù he added. ‚ÄúAnd that‚Äôs because he‚Äôs planning on making a lot of changes. ‚Äù The eight men around a rectangular table, sipping coffee from a hodgepodge of mugs donated by customers, meet daily for breakfasts of French toast, eggs and bacon at Darrell‚Äôs diner, all while solving the world‚Äôs problems, hence their gathering‚Äôs nickname. Washington may be veering from one Trump   controversy to another: unproved reports of Russia‚Äôs holding embarrassing information against him, possible ethical conflicts, the donors and billionaires of his cabinet, his pushback against intelligence findings on Russian hacking in the election. But there does not seem to be much angst in Iowa among those who voted for Mr. Trump, including some Democrats and independents. Monticello, in rural eastern Iowa, is as close as any place to the epicenter of the political quake that made Mr. Trump president. The state‚Äôs longstanding reputation as a political bellwether had led The New York Times to move me to Iowa for a full year ahead of its presidential caucuses in early 2016. I had not returned since. In the intervening year, Iowa gave  Mr. Trump his largest triumph of any battleground state: a    reversal over President Obama‚Äôs easy victory here in 2012. Al Ameling, 58, a technical analyst who lives in Marble Rock, near the Minnesota border, is representative of the profound demographic shift among white rural voters in the northern Midwest that helped produce Mr. Trump‚Äôs stunning upset. Mr. Ameling voted for Mr. Obama in 2008, sat out in 2012 and enthusiastically backed Mr. Trump. Nothing he has heard since Election Day has shaken his support, including reports this week that American intelligence agencies are investigating unverified accounts of meetings between Trump aides and Russian officials, as well as sex tapes purportedly made of Mr. Trump in Moscow. On Wednesday, Mr. Trump called the allegations completely false. ‚ÄúThe way it is nowadays, unless I see positive proof, it‚Äôs all a lie,‚Äù Mr. Ameling said in a telephone interview on Wednesday. He added he was more concerned that government officials might have leaked the material to the news media. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know if it was classified, but if it was, whoever leaked it needs to go to jail,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWe need law and order back in this country. ‚Äù I headed to Monticello because it was the site of Hillary Clinton‚Äôs first campaign stop after declaring her candidacy for the Democratic nomination in 2015. When she rolled up in her black van, a pack of journalists took off at a run, myself included, an enduringly silly image. Mrs. Clinton rarely returned to the state in the general election campaign, giving it up as all but lost. Jones County, which includes Monticello, is the birthplace of the painter Grant Wood, and where older men still wear the style of pinstriped overalls in his ‚ÄúAmerican Gothic. ‚Äù It is a beautiful place, with bald eagles soaring over wintry farm fields. Mr. Trump carried the county by 20 percentage points Mr. Obama easily won there four years earlier. At Darrell‚Äôs, there are actually two Tables of Knowledge, one favored by Democrats and the other by Republicans. Among them are an optometrist, farmers and former employees of a utility company. I asked if there was anyone who had voted for Mr. Trump after having previously supported Mr. Obama. ‚ÄúYeah, there is, but they won‚Äôt tell you,‚Äù said Mr. Retzlaff, an outspoken conservative who usually chooses to sit with the liberals. Mel Manternach, a retired farmer, said many farmers who had once voted for Mr. Obama switched to Mr. Trump, which he found perplexing. ‚ÄúTrump was against T. P. P. which would help exports of ag commodities,‚Äù he said, referring to the   Partnership, a   deal. ‚ÄúThey voted against their own  . ‚Äù The Iowans I interviewed largely went about their lives outside the political hothouse of social media. They did not follow    developments of the presidential transition. Indeed, on Wednesday, several were unfamiliar with the reports that Russia was holding compromising information on the   which Mr. Trump addressed in a news conference. Many were hazy on specific policy details about how, say, House Republicans were seeking to replace Medicare with a voucher system. These voters feared an outbreak of   terrorist attacks by Muslims in the United States, maybe in their own communities. And overwhelmingly, Trump supporters did not want their   money redistributed to people they regarded as undeserving. A year ago, I shadowed a Clinton   in Newton, a small city in central Iowa that has struggled since Maytag closed a washing machine plant. Jeff McKibben, one of the   workers, traded down for work at a prison. Once a ‚Äústraight Democrat,‚Äù as he called himself, he refused to commit at the time to support Mrs. Clinton. Contacted recently, he did not want to say how he voted, although Jasper County, which includes Newton, was one of the more than 30 Iowa counties that swung to Mr. Trump from Mr. Obama. ‚ÄúMaybe it‚Äôs time to have some change,‚Äù Mr. McKibben allowed. ‚ÄúI saw neighbors I knew were strong union people with Trump signs in their yards. ‚Äù The story was the same in Des Moines County, in southeastern Iowa. The local Democratic Party chairwoman, Sandy Dockendorff, knew there was trouble when she saw a Trump sign in the yard of an electrician who had always supported Democrats. ‚ÄúWhen I called him,‚Äù Ms. Dockendorff explained last month to a group of demoralized activists at a United Steelworkers union hall, ‚Äúhe said, ‚ÄòYou stopped talking my language you don‚Äôt care about jobs.‚Äô ‚Äù In an interview, Ms. Dockendorff, who is running for chairwoman of the state Democratic Party, said rural Iowans were critical of Democrats for opposing   projects like oil pipelines while running a presidential campaign focused narrowly on Mr. Trump‚Äôs shortcomings. ‚ÄúIt was all about making fun of Donald Trump  ‚Äî   he would never be president and how horrible it would be,‚Äù she said. But ‚Äúthe only one talking about jobs was Trump,‚Äù Ms. Dockendorff added. At a Des Moines County diner in Burlington, a small city on the Mississippi River, Melissa Ell, a waitress, said she had voted for Mr. Obama in 2012. But this Election Day, she stayed home. ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt want to vote for either one of them, to be honest,‚Äù she said. Ms. Ell, 46, earns a base wage of $6. 50 an hour at Jerry‚Äôs Main Lunch, a   restaurant across from the Burlington Northern Railroad tracks. As she bused a table, Ms. Ell commiserated with Jackie Furman about those who take advantage of government aid. ‚ÄúI think they should be   if they‚Äôre on welfare,‚Äù Ms. Ell said. ‚ÄúThe welfare system needs to be reorganized,‚Äù agreed Ms. Furman, a retired commercial bakery manager, complaining that ‚ÄúChicago people‚Äù were moving to Burlington to receive higher benefits and bringing crime. Ms. Furman, 70, said, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm ashamed to say we caucused for Obama‚Äù in 2008. ‚ÄúMy view is he purposely got into the presidency so he could ruin America. ‚Äù There are contrary views. On Washington Street in Burlington, I expected Post 10102 of the Veterans of Foreign Wars to be a bastion of support for the   who had promised repeatedly to ‚Äútake care of the vets. ‚Äù But there was deep skepticism. ‚ÄúForget about me,‚Äù Dan Meade, a Navy veteran, said. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs going to happen to our kids, our grandkids? I think the guy‚Äôs nuts. ‚Äù He and three others sipped $1. 50 draft beers from plastic cups. They sarcastically echoed notable Trump lines from the campaign trail. ‚ÄúHe knows more than the generals he doesn‚Äôt like prisoners of war,‚Äù Dan Warren, an Army veteran, said. ‚ÄúWhen Trump was running for office he said he‚Äôd run the country like he runs his companies,‚Äù Fran Boyle, who served in the Navy, chimed in. ‚ÄúWhich one of his bankrupt companies is he going to run it like?‚Äù Still, Trump voters in the state say they are hoping for the best. Mike Staudt, a retired farmer from Marble Rock, voted for Mr. Obama in 2012, but called the Affordable Care Act a form of socialism. He said he had no problem with a candidate who had run as the voice of the working people but was stocking his cabinet with the ultrawealthy. ‚ÄúI know these guys are really rich,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThey may have pulled off a few plays that weren‚Äôt exactly on the    but they all had to be pretty smart to be billionaires. If they replace their own concerns with the concerns of the country, they can make things really move forward. That‚Äôs what I‚Äôm excited about. ‚Äù",Foregin,

Posted by Elliot Bougis | Nov 18, 2016 | National Security Trump/Pence 2016: Lawful Good vs. Chaotic Evil 
I‚Äôm a nerd but please bear with me: 
Yesterday I asked some friends online about an economic theory that some of them are interested in and one friend, who does not support this theory, made a joke about ‚Äúgetting the Marxists out of the way first.‚Äù A little later a friend who does support the theory replied with irritation that it must be a joke to think Marxists are actually in power in this country. 
I won‚Äôt bore you with the rest of the discussion, but imagine my surprise when I saw an article this morning about‚Äìwait for it‚Äìpowerful Marxists in America! 
As Michael Volpe reports at The Daily Caller: 
A Marxist, a Venezuelan diplomat and an illegal alien headlined a meeting of organizers of the Trump resistance as they announced their plan to shut down Chicago on Saturday and Washington, D.C. on Inauguration Day. Chicago ANSWER was one of the radical leftist groups that helped to organize anti-Trump protests when his campaign tried to hold a rally in March ; that rally was canceled after protesters clashed with attendees. As The DC reported last week , the group is responsible for organizing rallies in Chicago, New York, Washington, D.C., San Francisco and Albuquerque. Since holding those rallies, the group has announced ‚Äúmass marches‚Äù on Inauguration Day in Washington and another one in Chicago on Saturday; the group hopes to ‚Äúshut the streets down‚Äù at both rallies. In other words, if they can‚Äôt win an election legally, they‚Äôll try to reverse it with violence and ‚Äúbirddogging‚Äù chaos. Before we go any further down this sad road, I want you to keep two things in mind. First, this is what Marxism always does. When it fails one group of people, it oozes away like a red version of The Blob to consume some other poor, unsuspecting populace with its cultural and economic acids. Now that Marxism has left Venezuela devastated and poor, the swarm of Marxist fire ants are trying to do the same here. The Socialist Blob: Coming Soon To A Community Center Near You! Second, like a lot of critics of Trump, these Marxist ants don‚Äôt listen to his positive message and policy proposals. Instead, like a swarm of worker ants following their queen, the mainstream media, they fixate on the ‚Äúracist‚Äù or ‚Äúsexist‚Äù or ‚Äúmean‚Äù things Trump reportedly said. As I wrote yesterday, Trump hired Steve Bannon for many reasons, but one reason in particular is because they both care about economic justice, middle-class prosperity, and a strong national labor force. So remember: 1) these ants are making trouble for Trump because they smell fresh meat after leaving rotten meat in other places and 2) they are fighting a presidency that will actually help the people they say they care about. Now back to Volpe‚Äôs report: On Nov. 15, the group held a meeting to plot its next move in its ongoing resistance of the Trump in a space normally operated by the Mexican Solidarity Network, a less well-known group in the mold of La Raza. CHICAGO ANSWER organizers, Stephanie and Mika, co-chaired the evening and Mika said he was also an organizer with the Party for Socialist and Liberation, a radical Marxist group and a frequent partner of ANSWER. Mika fired up the crowd. ‚ÄúWhat do want?‚Äù he yelled at the crowd. ‚ÄúJustice,‚Äù the crowd roared back. Same as Donald Trump! Law and order! Drain the swamp! ‚ÄúWhen do we want it,‚Äù he screamed again. ‚ÄúNow,‚Äù the crowd roared even louder. ‚ÄúPeople can and must be organized in a deepening resistance,‚Äù Stephanie said. ‚ÄúAs united as possible, as militant as possible.‚Äù She also said she was willing to ‚Äúwork with anyone to resist this administration.‚Äù Because these ants have no ideas or skills to contribute to society, they prefer to tear anyone who is trying to help in concrete ways‚Äìhence they hate a celebrated DOER like Donald Trump. Jes√∫s Rodr√≠guez-Espinoza is the Counsel General for the Venezuelan consulate in Chicago and while the rest of the speakers accused Trump of the normal litany of grievances ‚Äî that he‚Äôs a racist, homophobe, misogynist and charlatan ‚Äî Rodriguez said his diplomatic position forbade him from weighing in on Trump. ‚ÄúBefore I was the Counsel General in Chicago, I was a regular citizen in Venezuela just like you, in 2002, was moved in my basement because of the attack against Hugo Chavez. Because of that I started getting involved in politics. Rodriguez-Espinoza said he became a supporter of Chavez after that. Just goes to show: never trust a Jesus that isn‚Äôt in the Bible. Rodriquez-Espinoza also claimed the current economic and humanitarian crisis in Venezuela is over-blown. ‚ÄúAll the humanitarian crisis that you hear in the media most of that is an exaggeration. The only crisis we face is destabilization in Venezuelan oil. I‚Äôm not saying everything is perfect; I‚Äôm just saying it‚Äôs overmagnified because it‚Äôs in the interest of the most powerful countries in the world to get rid of the progressive government in Venezuela.‚Äù According to a June Guardian story , Venezuela has an economic crisis where Gross Domestic Product is contracting by 8 percent, unemployment was at 17 percent, and the inflation rate was at 482 percent. As always, facts are inconvenient things at times. Plus, if oil is Venezuela‚Äôs main (only??) economic problem, then people like Rodriguez-Espinoza should try to work with Trump as a successful business developer, dealmaker, and, as of this Tuesday, the President-elect over the largest oil discovery in America of all time (20 BILLION barrels in the Permian Basin in southwest Texas). But because he is a short-sighted ant, Roqriguez-Espinoza, and all Marxist ants, to be honest, only know how to swarm and scurry and bite so they can feel ‚Äúprogressive.‚Äù Far be it from them to take the humble, slow route of working, developing, building, and planning like Trump and most of his supporters do on a daily basis.

"Writing at the Guardian newspaper, global warming advocate Bill McKibben claimed that President Donald Trump and White House Chief Strategist Steve Bannon are ‚Äúcounting on‚Äù a terrorist ‚Äúmassacre‚Äù on American soil to ‚Äútilt things their way. ‚Äù[McKibben, who has contributed numerous opinion pieces to the Guardian, wrote a column titled ‚ÄúDonald Trump and Steve Bannon have turned the White House against America. ‚Äù  In the piece, McKibben claimed the White House, which he argued was acting more like a ‚ÄúBlack Tower,‚Äù was ‚Äúsending out its Breitbartian orcs and   winged harpies to poison the politics of a nation. ‚Äù He referred to Trump‚Äôs temporary halt on refugees while the U. S. revamps its flawed screening process as an ‚Äúimmigration ban,‚Äù which McKibben claimed was actually a ‚Äúcalculated assault‚Äù on Muslims, morality, and ‚Äúon simple kindness. ‚Äù ‚ÄúIt was a probe to find out if Americans would come to the defense of a minority that we‚Äôd been told to fear and hate,‚Äù he claimed.  ‚ÄúAnd it failed  ‚Äî   not because a federal judge struck down the ban, but because Americans in their millions poured into airport baggage terminals and city squares. ‚Äù McKibben went on to charge that Trump and Bannon may be ‚Äúcounting on a   Bowling Green massacre to tilt things their way. ‚Äù He wrote: The outpouring was not a show of Muslim strength  ‚Äî   there really isn‚Äôt much Muslim strength in America. It was a demonstration that, for the moment, our moral commitment to the underdog still holds. But there are no guarantees: morality can bend pretty easily in the face of fear, and you know that Bannon and Trump are counting on a   Bowling Green massacre to tilt things their way. And in any event, morality is the not the only pillar they‚Äôre after. Next on the list is reason: the attack on climate science is, in fact, an attack on science itself, on the enterprise that undergirds modernity. McKibben‚Äôs charge about a ‚ÄúBowling Green massacre‚Äù referred to an error made by Trump adviser Kellyanne Conway, who mistakenly said that ‚ÄúPresident Obama had a   ban on the Iraqi refugee program after two Iraqis came here to this country, were radicalized and were the masterminds behind the Bowling Green massacre. ‚Äù In actuality, Obama‚Äôs State Department in 2011 reportedly imposed a six month freeze on the processing of Iraqi refugees. The halt was the result of the discovery of two   members admitted as refugees from Iraq who were living in Bowling Green, Kentucky and admitted to targeting U. S. troops in Iraq. McKibben is founder of 350. org, which bills itself as a grassroots group building a ‚Äúglobal climate movement. ‚Äù  The group is funded by the George   Tides Foundation and a slew of   philanthropies. In a 2010 review of one of his books, Time magazine opined that McKibben ‚Äúmay be the world‚Äôs best green journalist. ‚Äù Aaron Klein is Breitbart‚Äôs Jerusalem bureau chief and senior investigative reporter. He is a New York Times bestselling author and hosts the popular weekend talk radio program, ‚ÄúAaron Klein Investigative Radio. ‚Äù Follow him on Twitter @AaronKleinShow.

The conservative political machine has been working overtime to try to deny that the government of the Russian Federation is interfering with the American election in support of Republican nominee Donald Trump ‚Äì but this explosive investigation by former Daily Show correspondent Samantha Bee proves once and for all that dictator Vladimir Putin is using every tool at his disposal to tilt the scale in favor of Trump. 
Samantha Bee, now the host of her own show, traveled to Moscow to interview two of the ‚Äúthinkfluencers,‚Äù members of Putin‚Äôs underground troll farms that pose as Americans online and flood social media with pro-Russian and pro-Trump propaganda. 
‚ÄúThe reason I‚Äôm hired is to make simple people change their mind about their vote and also about Russia‚Äù said one woman, who admitted she identifies herself as a Nebraskan housewife online. When asked why they thought their propaganda was working, she replied it was because Americans are ‚Äúlazy and they believe everything they read.‚Äù",Foregin,
"In the battle against the Islamic State for Mosul, Iraq‚Äôs   city, there is no continuous front line, but a patchwork of battlegrounds in the city and all around its edge. When the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL, retreats from a position, it tries to leave as much damage behind as possible, including burning oil field wells to provide concealment ahead of a government advance. Snipers are also in place, ready to strike. A village or neighborhood that is retaken by government troops could soon be flooded again with extremist fighters, who are rarely far away. I recently spent three weeks in this volatile zone, first with the Iraqi Army in eastern Mosul and then, after setbacks for the army, whose    battle of attrition was not going the way it had hoped, with units of the Iraqi federal police. The police, traveling in armored vehicles, are playing a significant role in the battle for Mosul, sometimes supporting the army. They are also responsible for holding their own territory around the city. The police have been tasked with maintaining areas of the front line nearby, ISIS fighters are ready and in position. When holding ground and not on an advance, the two sides intermittently exchange rifle and mortar fire,   shows of force that tend to harass more than inflict serious casualties. For the two days I was embedded with the police, they had been ordered to pause in their advance. So for the most part, they were left to wait along a muddy front until the next push forward. For the civilians trapped by the fighting, life is bleak, and most are desperate to leave. Areas along the contested front have no water, no electricity and no way for people to obtain basic supplies. Those trapped by the fighting and those who return hoping to restart their lives  ‚Äî   or at least to recover some belongings  ‚Äî   are at risk of being caught in the   and injuries and deaths among civilians are increasing. When government forces liberate an area, most civilians act quickly to try to evacuate. However, the Islamic State appears eager to keep as many civilians as possible in the urban center, using them as shields against aggressive bombing campaigns by the government and coalition forces. Anyone seen fleeing risks a sniper attack. Government troops sometimes escort families to safety, urging them to hurry through streets that offer little cover. Once civilians reach a safe zone, a more organized system is in place to transport them in buses and on the backs of trucks to camps for displaced people. On the way, they receive donations of food and water. Iraqi forces have been told to destroy evidence of the Islamic State after retaking an area, but signs of its control can sometimes be difficult to efface. Coalition   bombings destroyed an Islamic State training base in a former agricultural college in the town of Hamam Alil, below. But ISIS writing, which states the name of a unit, remains visible on the wall. Residents, like the women below in the town of Bashiqa, are starting to return to areas recently freed from the Islamic State to learn what became of their homes and to gather the few belongings that have not been looted or destroyed. The woman below was recovering a wedding photo from the rubble in Bashiqa, northeast of Mosul. The town, famous for its olive groves, was once a popular day trip destination from the city and had a large population of Yazidis. The Islamic State‚Äôs control of Mosul and the nearby area separated families for long stretches. The relatives below, reunited on the side of the road, had not seen one another in two years. The battle for Mosul has forced many tens of thousands from their homes, and displaced people are a common sight along the roads across the city. Early in my assignment, I accompanied the Iraqi Army to this neighborhood below, which is in the eastern part of Mosul, where civilians dared to venture outside as government troops patrolled. But just a few hours after this photo was taken, Islamic State fighters attacked an Iraqi Army field base nearby, killing soldiers, destroying their armored vehicles and almost immediately posting a YouTube video triumphantly showing their accomplishment. After that, access for photographers was severely curtailed by the army, and journalists quickly went from having a   seat to this very critical battle to struggling to get any information at all. Ambulances carrying those gravely injured from sniper fire, artillery, mortars and mines are driven out of Mosul in a steady flow en route to hospitals in nearby Erbil. When fighting is heavy, dozens of injured people arrive at the hospitals every hour. Field hospitals inside Mosul have few supplies, so victims must be evacuated to where they can be treated. Some do not survive the journey. The emergency vehicles offered me one of the most reliable indications of how the battle was going, and a chance to document the results. The government has been trying to consolidate its gains, first in the outer provincial villages, and now in suburbs and city districts ever closer to the city center. But the Islamic State had a long time to prepare for this battle, and its fighters are skilled and   taking full advantage of their underground network of tunnels throughout the region. A long and difficult fight lies ahead for Iraqi forces trying to liberate Mosul, like this lone federal policeman on a still very dangerous and shifting front line.",Foregin,
"Finally. The Second Avenue subway opened in New York City on Sunday, with thousands of riders flooding into its polished stations to witness a piece of history nearly a century in the making. They descended beneath the streets of the Upper East Side of Manhattan to board Q trains bound for Coney Island in Brooklyn. They cheered. Their eyes filled with tears. They snapped selfies in front of colorful mosaics lining the walls of the stations. It was the first day of 2017, and it felt like a new day for a city that for so long struggled to build this sorely needed subway line. In a rare display of unbridled optimism from hardened New Yorkers, they arrived with huge grins and wide eyes, taking in the bells and whistles at three new stations. ‚ÄúI was very choked up,‚Äù Betsy Morris, 70, said as she rode the first train to leave the 96th Street station, at noon. ‚ÄúHow do you explain something that you never thought would happen? It‚Äôs going to change the way everybody lives as far as commuting goes. ‚Äù It was a major moment for New York‚Äôs sprawling transit system after decades of failed efforts to bring the line to one of the few corners of Manhattan the subway did not reach. The opening of the first segment of the line  ‚Äî   an extension of the Q train to 96th Street  ‚Äî   promises to lighten the crush of passengers on the Nos. 4, 5 and 6 trains along Lexington Avenue, the nation‚Äôs most overcrowded subway line, which had been the only line on the Upper East Side of Manhattan. When the stations opened shortly before noon, they were quickly filled with giddy riders both young and old, and strollers, suitcases and dogs  ‚Äî   all familiar sights across the system. But for all the excitement, the line, with just three new stops, is much more modest than the ambitious route running the length of Manhattan that was once envisioned. It serves a relatively affluent and not very diverse part of the city, which has more than eight and a half million people and many   and minority residents who live far from a subway line. With the subway reaching its highest ridership levels since 1948, much of the aging system is plagued by crowding and delays, even as subway and bus fares are expected to rise again in March. Still, there was reason to cheer. The opening of a new subway line is a rare occasion in the United States and comes at a time of mounting concern about the deteriorating state of the nation‚Äôs infrastructure, from its roadways and bridges to its public transit systems. Few new subway stations have opened in recent years, even as expansive subway networks have sprouted in Asia, and most American cities never built any in the first place. The major subways in the Northeast  ‚Äî   in New York, Washington and Boston  ‚Äî   are grappling with old equipment and funding shortfalls, with Washington experiencing a near meltdown over safety problems. With mounting bills for basic maintenance, these subways have largely failed to grow. So the arrival of the   Second Avenue subway, which was first proposed in the 1920s, was a notable achievement for the   Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which runs the city‚Äôs vast network of subways, buses and commuter railroads. The first phase of the project took nearly a decade to build and cost about $4. 4 billion. With the opening, the map of the city‚Äôs loved and loathed subway adds three new stations, bringing the total to 472  ‚Äî   the most of any subway in the world. A station that opened at Hudson Yards on Manhattan‚Äôs Far West Side in 2015 was the city‚Äôs first new station in a  . On Sunday, New Yorkers were mesmerized by the artwork adorning the walls. At the 72nd Street stop, Sumana Harihareswara stopped to gaze at a mosaic of a woman of South Asian descent dressed in a burgundy sari, looking at her cellphone. Ms. Harihareswara was overcome with emotion. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever come across subway art before that makes me feel so seen,‚Äù she said through tears. ‚ÄúThis woman could be my aunt she could be my cousin. ‚Äù She and a stranger exchanged a knowing glance. ‚ÄúRepresentation matters,‚Äù they agreed. Ms. Harihareswara, a longtime transit enthusiast from Astoria, Queens, said she was struck by the diversity portrayed in the mosaics, including a mural of a gay couple holding hands. ‚ÄúThere is no feeling quite like seeing yourself cemented into the infrastructure of New York,‚Äù Ms. Harihareswara said. After decades of aborted efforts to build the Second Avenue line, and at least three groundbreakings in the 1970s, construction on the current segment began in 2007. The line was originally projected to open in 2013, but subway officials pushed the deadline to the end of 2016 many years ago. Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, a Democrat who effectively controls the authority, pressed officials to meet the December 2016 deadline even as concerns grew that the subway would not be ready in time. Still, the agency made the deadline  ‚Äî   just barely  ‚Äî   with a lavish inaugural ride on New Year‚Äôs Eve for a collection of dignitaries that culminated in a midnight toast. Although many New Yorkers believe the city runs the subways, it is actually the governor who appoints the authority‚Äôs chairman and holds considerable sway over the agency. Mr. Cuomo has capitalized on the Second Avenue opening to raise his national profile, overshadowing his frequent nemesis Mayor Bill de Blasio, a Democrat who attended the inaugural ride on Saturday but was not given a speaking slot. Despite general good will over the opening, some transit advocates expressed concerns over the high cost of the project and questioned whether officials would move aggressively to extend the line to 125th Street in East Harlem as planned. On Sunday morning, Mr. Cuomo arrived at the 96th Street station with the authority‚Äôs chairman, Thomas F. Prendergast, to join the first trip for regular riders, who cheered as the train pulled out of the station. Then Mr. Cuomo‚Äôs voice came over the loudspeaker. ‚ÄúRest assured: I‚Äôm not driving the train,‚Äù he joked. The first day of service was smooth, although there were a few hiccups. Around 3 p. m. there were delays on the Q line because of a train with mechanical problems at the City Hall station. About an hour earlier, the elevator at the new 86th Street stop had begun to malfunction, stranding passengers above and below ground. Strollers were wheeled onto steep escalators. Parents became upset. Jill Tallmer, 62, and her mother, Margot Tallmer, 91, contemplated visiting another day. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve been waiting for 10 years, or more, to ride,‚Äù the younger Ms. Tallmer said while standing with her mother, a lifelong New Yorker who is in a wheelchair. ‚ÄúHopefully, it‚Äôs almost ready for us. ‚Äù It was not, and they left after a few minutes. At the 72nd Street station, George Braith, a jazz saxophonist, was being mobbed by an eager pack of veritable paparazzi. The reason for his newfound celebrity: His likeness is featured in a mosaic there. ‚ÄúWould you look at that guy?‚Äù Mr. Braith, 77, said. ‚ÄúPretty handsome fellow if you ask me. ‚Äù He is one of several local celebrities portrayed in the artwork, including chef Daniel Boulud.

"If President Donald Trump‚Äôs promised border wall stops only a small fraction of illegal aliens from coming into the U. S. it would save the U. S. billions and easily cover the cost of the wall, a report released Thursday finds. [The   Center for Immigration Studies (CIS) using the estimated education level of illegal alien border crossers and immigrant education estimates from National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (NAS) found that each illegal alien entering the U. S. racks up at least $74, 722 in lifetime costs, funded by American taxpayers.  ‚Äú[I]f a border wall stopped a small fraction of the illegal immigrants who are expected to come in the next decade, the fiscal savings from having fewer illegal immigrants in the country would be sufficient to cover the costs of the wall,‚Äù writes CIS Director of Research Steven Camarota.  Even a minimally effective border wall that stopped less than ten percent of illegal crossings would save the U. S. billions. ‚ÄúIf a border wall stopped between 160, 000 and 200, 000 illegal crossers ‚Äî  nine to 12 percent of those expected to successfully cross in the next decade ‚Äî  the scaled savings would equal the $12 to $15 billion cost of the wall,‚Äù Camarota writes. Approximately 170, 000 illegal aliens crossed into the U. S. without going through a port of entry in 2015, according to a study commissioned by the Department of Homeland Security. ‚Äú[T]here may be 1. 7 million successful crossings in the next decade. If a wall stopped just 9 to 12 percent of these crossings it would pay for itself,‚Äù the CIS report states. ‚Äú[T]here may be 1. 7 million successful crossings in the next decade. If a wall stopped just 9 to 12 percent of these crossings it would pay for itself,‚Äù the CIS report states. ‚ÄúIf a wall stopped half of those expected to successfully enter illegally without going through a port of entry at the southern border over the next 10 years, it would save taxpayers nearly $64 billion ‚Äî  several times the wall‚Äôs cost,‚Äù the report adds. And that‚Äôs excluding the cost of children produced by illegal immigrants. The federal government imposes a massive, unfunded mandate on school districts around the country by forcing American parents to divert funding from their own children to educate roughly 3. 62 million foreign students, many of whom are extremely   students and do not speak English. The Federation for American Immigration Reform (FAIR) found it costs taxpayers $59. 8 billion per year to educate roughly 3. 62 million   students, children with one or two legal migrant parents, and refugees. Approximately one in ten students enrolled in public schools is designated as Limited English Proficiency (LEP) and their academic performance has been described as ‚Äúabominable‚Äù: The number of eighth to twelfth grade LEP students performing Advanced work rounds to zero percent, for example.

In September the National ICE Council, representing some 5,000 Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers charged with protecting the country‚Äôs borders, did something it has never done: It endorsed a candidate for president: Donald Trump. In its statement at the time, the union said: In [Trump‚Äôs] immigration policy, he has outlined core policies needed to restore immigration security ‚Äî including support for increased interior enforcement and border security, an end to Sanctuary Cities, an end to catch-and-release, mandatory retainers, and the canceling of executive amnesty and non-enforcement directives. 
On the contrary, said the union, Hillary Clinton supports furthering ‚Äúamnesty‚Äù and a ‚Äúradical‚Äù immigration plan that will cost thousands of Americans not only their jobs but their lives . 
On Friday the union issued a ‚Äúfinal warning,‚Äù expanding its concern about how open borders would cost Americans their lives. Wrote the council‚Äôs president, Chris Crane: Hillary‚Äôs pledge for ‚Äòopen borders‚Äô will mean disaster for our country, and turn the present border emergency into a cataclysm. Hillary‚Äôs plan would unleash violent cartels and brutal transnational gangs into US communities and cause countless preventable deaths‚Ä¶. ICE officers on the front lines are witnessing a deluge of illegal immigration unlike anything we have seen before. The corporate-funded media won‚Äôt cover it. Our officers are being ordered to release recent border-crossers with no idea what their intentions are or what they are planning. Gang members, drug cartels and violent smugglers are taking advantage of the situation and threatening American communities. The influx is overwhelming public resources, especially in poor communities ‚Äî including Hispanic communities and immigrant communities bearing the economic brunt of the illegal immigration surge. 
There are economic, cultural, and moral reasons for concerns about open borders, as noted by economist Gene Callahan. Unlimited immigration would likely lead to lower wages for Americans who would have to cut their wage demands or be replaced by immigrant workers willing to work for lower wages. 
Culturally an unlimited dumping of immigrants onto an unprepared and unsuspecting culture would alter that culture irreparably. Consider the Native American culture, he said: If Native Americans had been able to limit the flow of European immigrants, they might have been able to preserve their land and cultures. 
Morally there is a responsibility to take care of those less able to care for themselves but not to the point of reducing their own circumstances to penury: While the rich have an obligation to help the poor, that obligation does not extend to the degree that they must become poor themselves. 
Since every resident in the United States, except maybe for those Native Americans, is either an immigrant or a descendent of one, it makes sense to welcome immigrants. Until 1875, there were no immigration laws. But with the passage of the Page Act of 1875, legislators began defining the procedures under which those desiring to immigrate into the country would have to follow. 
Since then immigration laws have been heavily modified, but they have always defined those procedures and conditions. If the laws need to be changed again, then legislators should change them. But they must be followed, not ignored for political purposes. Otherwise, unintended consequences, such as those noted in the ICE Council‚Äôs warning, will overtake the culture and risk destroying the very culture that makes it presently so inviting for those seeking a better life.

"In the winding hallways and stuffy rooms of an old factory in Brooklyn, under bulbs flickering as if in a horror movie, an elite new police unit prepares, over and over again, for the attack it knows is coming. Day after day, the officers comb the highest floor of the building, looking for witnesses to point them to the right door and listening for gunshots like those that have echoed all over the world in recent months. They are conducting exercises to help them hunt down an ‚Äúactive shooter. ‚Äù ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs going to happen,‚Äù said Chief James R. Waters, who leads the New York Police Department‚Äôs Counterterrorism Bureau. ‚ÄúSomething like Orlando‚Äôs going to happen. ‚Äù Last year, the police announced the creation of a heavily armed and armored regiment called the Critical Response Command. Teams of officers work all over the city and are trained to respond to many locations in three to five minutes. They represent a new response to a new threat. Gone are the days when the first officers on a scene set up a perimeter and waited for backup or a   team. The perpetrators of the most recent wave of mass shootings around the world  ‚Äî   Paris San Bernardino, Calif. Orlando, Fla.  ‚Äî   were not interested in taking hostages and negotiating. They came to kill for the sake of killing. And these officers are trained to find and stop them. On Thursday, Chief Waters allowed journalists from The New York Times to watch the Critical Response Command train. ‚ÄúThis is seven months of work,‚Äù he said, standing before a team of officers in bulletproof vests who were cradling Colt M4 semiautomatic rifles. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs incredible progress. ‚Äù The officers were practicing in a former pharmaceutical factory on Flushing Avenue in the Fort Greene neighborhood. The Police Department is not listed among the building‚Äôs tenants, but it has worked there since before the command‚Äôs creation. The journalists were allowed to observe the exercises under restrictions. A photographer and videographer were forbidden to document the command as it moved in drills, and a reporter was asked to describe the tactics only in broad strokes. Department leaders believe terrorists study descriptions of police training in preparation for attacks. ‚ÄúThe perpetrators in France demonstrated a familiarity with the French response,‚Äù Deputy Chief Scott Shanley said, referring to the coordinated attacks in Paris that killed more than 130 people in November. The officers, who also played the roles of gunmen and bystanders, conducted two exercises. The first began with a dispatcher‚Äôs call: shots fired in the building. Officers in a patrol car would typically be the first to respond in this situation, and that was the case in the drill. Two officers, clutching pistols, entered the hallway, crouching, one in front and the other behind him with a hand on the first officer‚Äôs back. Officers in the command do not know the details of an exercise beforehand. Suddenly, a man ran toward them, screaming for help. The officers ordered him to his knees and asked about the gunman the man pointed down the hall. The officers hurried around a corner. Gunfire rang out. ‚ÄúShots fired!‚Äù the rear officer shouted into his radio, and the pair ran to the sound. A masked gunman, wearing green fatigues in a room with cubicles, opened fire. The officers fired back. Rounds with a chalklike substance, similar to paintballs, struck the gunman. He fell to the floor. The rear officer shouted ‚ÄúLoading! Loading! Loading!‚Äù and ejected a spent magazine from his pistol, sliding in a new one. The other officer bent and took the gunman‚Äôs pulse. Dead. They called for backup and waited. What followed was an extraordinary show of paramilitary precision and force. New Yorkers have grown accustomed to seeing heavily armed officers standing in subway stations and at city landmarks. They have not seen what journalists were allowed to see on Thursday  ‚Äî   a response to an   scene from within the scene itself. The door through which the first responding officers had entered crept open again, and a head popped out. Then the entire team emerged, six officers in this case, moving fast in single file, each touching the back of the man before him. They seemed to move as a single organism, like a long black snake darting across the hall to the closest door. There was no hesitation at the door, no peeking inside. The officers burst through and moved in different directions. ‚ÄúA dynamic entry,‚Äù Capt. Eugene McCarthy said, watching. ‚ÄúThe perpetrator‚Äôs processing is disrupted by dynamic entry,‚Äù Deputy Chief John O‚ÄôConnell said, standing beside him. To demonstrate, the command later allowed journalists to stand in an empty room and wait for the team to enter. The silence was startling, unnerving. The officers did not speak as they snaked toward the room. They communicated in pats on the back and hand signals. There was no warning of their arrival. One moment, the room was empty. A heartbeat later, it was filled with the six men and their guns. Traditionally, when officers stormed a room, the first one was known as the ‚Äúrabbit,‚Äù likely drawing the fire of the gunman inside while the second officer took aim at him. With this team, it was as if there were no rabbit  ‚Äî   the entire team seemed to swarm the room at once. In the exercise, the team joined the first two officers near the dead gunman, until they all heard more gunfire down the hall. The team regrouped into its line and raced toward the shots. The officer in front fired at a gunman, and others behind him stepped out of the line and did the same, and in what seemed like a second, that gunman was down and the drill over. The officers pulled off their helmets, sweating after minutes of intense action. Captain McCarthy stepped forward and ran through a quick review. The officer who played the second gunman praised the speed and accuracy of the officers who shot him. ‚ÄúNo    issues,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúGood job. ‚Äù An officer who played a victim, with fake blood on his leg, said: ‚ÄúNo shots on me. Good job. ‚Äù The officers switched roles and prepared to do it again, the details of the drill different this time. The strategy, though, was constant. ‚ÄúMove to the shooter,‚Äù Chief Waters said. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll hear it 50 times. Move to the shooter. It‚Äôs got to be ingrained. Like muscle memory. ‚Äù The Critical Response Command is made up of 525 handpicked officers and superiors who applied and were chosen after a screening process that included   interviews with Chief Waters and others. Their training must override lifelong human instinct. ‚ÄúIt goes against all their upbringing,‚Äù Chief Waters said. ‚ÄúThey have to walk past and run past victims on the ground. Kids crying. They‚Äôre grabbing at your legs. ‚Äù The training is always evolving with world events. The command recently introduced suicide belts into exercises. Chief Waters declined to elaborate. The visit on Thursday concluded with directions through more hallways to the elevator. There, waiting, one could hear, from behind, more gunfire.",Foregin,

The man who obliterated Donald Trump's Hollywood Walk of Fame star says on video that he just did it to 'help' people. 
The man, who identified himself to Deadline Hollywood as Jamie Otis, pretended to be a construction worker to give himself cover at 5:30 Wednesday morning, as he took a pickaxe and sledgehammer to the terrazzo and cement star. 
Trump earned the star, which is situated on Hollywood Boulevard near the Dolby Theater, in 2007 for his work on ‚ÄúCelebrity Apprentice.‚Äù But in just a few minutes it was destroyed:

Now the man has reappeared on video admitting the vandalism, but says he did it for an altruistic cause: 
‚ÄúI really wanted to do this. I think it's a symbol for all of us against sexual assault.‚Äù 
He said his intention was to sell pieces of the star to raise money for the women who have accused Trump of sexual wrongdoing. None of the women have provided concrete proof of their claims. 
The man, a self-proclaimed activist, admitted in an exclusive TMZ interview that this isn't his first rodeo: 
‚ÄúI'm a non violent activist. I've been arrested 24, 25 times. I'd love to go to court with Mr. Trump, it would be a great honor.‚Äù 
Without irony, the man claimed that Trump is ‚Äúa bully‚Äù and that he needs to ‚Äúease up.‚Äù 
This isn't the first time Trump's star has been the target of vandals. Recently, the star was surrounded by a cement box:

"Good morning. (Want to get California Today by email? Sign up.) Two European satellites have captured a stunning portrait of the subtle topographical shifts at work in the landscape of the San Francisco Bay Area. The Sentinel satellites, operated by the European Space Agency, have been snapping radar scans of the region since 2015 as part of their mission to collect data on the earth and oceans. Analysts have since compared the movement of physical features over time  ‚Äî   down to mere millimeters. Among the project‚Äôs starkest depictions are shifts along the Hayward Fault, the gradual sinking of reclaimed land in the San Rafael Bay, and the rise of the city of Pleasanton, a possible side effect of replenished groundwater. The images align with already understood geological processes, said Roland B√ºrgmann, a professor of earth and planetary science at U. C. Berkeley, who was not involved in the project. But scientists believe that the acute level of detail offered by the technology could deepen knowledge in a number of areas, among them structural engineering, earthquake prediction and insurance risk. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs developing a new potential for the world that has never existed,‚Äù said Dag Anders Moldestad, a senior adviser at the Norwegian Space Center who participated in the project. In the case of the Millennium Tower, it could also become a factor in a court fight as San Francisco wages a legal battle that accuses the developers of failing to disclose issues with the structural integrity of the downtown skyscraper. The Sentinel satellite images  ‚Äî   captured from early 2015 to September of this year  ‚Äî   show that the   luxury condominium building is sinking into the soft soil below at a rate of nearly two inches a year. A separate examination this year found that the tower had descended about 16 inches altogether, while tilting roughly six inches, since opening its doors in 2009. The developer has insisted that the building is safe. Nicholas Sitar, a professor of civil engineering at the University of California, Berkeley, said that a small amount of sinking was to be expected among structures on the reclaimed land along San Francisco‚Äôs waterfront. The Sentinel satellites, for example, found that the new Salesforce East tower, across the street from the Millennium Tower, was also sinking. The rapid rate of the Millennium Tower‚Äôs descent, however, was troubling, Dr. Sitar said. Not least to its concerned residents. ‚Ä¢ After the Democrats‚Äô demoralizing election defeat, Representative  Nancy Pelosi has become a symbol of what went wrong.

About a dozen readers wrote to point out the error: the towering rock in the photograph was Yosemite Valley‚Äôs Half Dome, not Sentinel Dome as the caption claimed. That made us wonder if it might be time for a visit. While summer tends to be the park‚Äôs busiest time of the year, Yosemite regulars will tell you it is never more blissfully serene than in the winter. Crucially, it‚Äôs much less crowded. In the summer, up to 600, 000 people visit each month, said Scott Gediman, a park spokesman. During the winter months, it‚Äôs usually fewer than 200, 000. ‚ÄúThe park is beautiful right now,‚Äù said Mr. Gediman, speaking by phone from the Yosemite Valley on Tuesday. ‚ÄúYosemite Falls is flowing. You‚Äôve got ice on the canyon walls. It‚Äôs just gorgeous and peaceful. ‚Äù Most of Yosemite is cloaked by snow in the winter, including at times the valley, which sits about 4, 000 feet above sea level. Visitors can ice skate, snowshoe,   ski or even hit the slopes. Established in 1935, Yosemite Ski and Snowboard Area, formerly known as Badger Pass, is California‚Äôs oldest ski area. According to Frank Dean, a former park ranger who lived in the valley for eight years, Yosemite in the winter offers pageants of nature that you don‚Äôt get the rest of the year. He recalled once going   skiing with some friends on New Year‚Äôs Eve. The sky had just cleared after a storm and a bright moon was illuminating a dusting of snow on the valley‚Äôs soaring granite walls. As the group passed by the luxury Ahwahnee Hotel, a onetime host of Queen Elizabeth II, they noticed a holiday celebration inside. ‚ÄúWe couldn‚Äôt afford to go to that party,‚Äù said Mr. Dean, who now runs the Yosemite Conservancy. ‚ÄúBut I was thinking, ‚ÄòBoy, I think we‚Äôre having the better deal out here. ‚Äô‚Äù California Today goes live at 6 a. m.

"Vladimir Putin at the Valdai International Discussion Club : ¬´Shaping the World of Tomorrow¬ª by Vladimir Putin Voltaire Network | Sochi (Russia) | 27 October 2016 fran√ßais —Ä—É—Å—Å–∫–∏–π Tarja, Heinz, Thabo, colleagues, ladies and gentlemen,
It is a great pleasure to see you again. I want to start by thanking all of the participants in the Valdai International Discussion Club, from Russia and abroad, for your constructive part in this work, and I want to thank our distinguished guests for their readiness to take part in this open discussion.
Our esteemed moderator just wished me a good departure into retirement, and I wish myself the same when the time comes. This is the right approach and the thing to do. But I am not retired yet and am for now the leader of this big country. As such, it is fitting to show restraint and avoid displays of excessive aggressiveness. I do not think that this is my style in any case.
But I do think that we should be frank with each other, particularly here in this gathering. I think we should hold candid, open discussions, otherwise our dialogue makes no sense and would be insipid and without the slightest interest.
I think that this style of discussion is extremely needed today given the great changes taking place in the world. The theme for our meeting this year, The Future in Progress: Shaping the World of Tomorrow, is very topical.
Last year, the Valdai forum participants discussed the problems with the current world order. Unfortunately, little has changed for the better over these last months. Indeed, it would be more honest to say that nothing has changed.
The tensions engendered by shifts in distribution of economic and political influence continue to grow. Mutual distrust creates a burden that narrows our possibilities for finding effective responses to the real threats and challenges facing the world today. Essentially, the entire globalisation project is in crisis today and in Europe, as we know well, we hear voices now saying that multiculturalism has failed.
I think this situation is in many respects the result of mistaken, hasty and to some extent over-confident choices made by some countries‚Äô elites a quarter-of-a-century ago. Back then, in the late 1980s-early 1990s, there was a chance not just to accelerate the globalisation process but also to give it a different quality and make it more harmonious and sustainable in nature.
But some countries that saw themselves as victors in the Cold War, not just saw themselves this way but said it openly, took the course of simply reshaping the global political and economic order to fit their own interests.
In their euphoria, they essentially abandoned substantive and equal dialogue with other actors in international life, chose not to improve or create universal institutions, and attempted instead to bring the entire world under the spread of their own organisations, norms and rules. They chose the road of globalisation and security for their own beloved selves, for the select few, and not for all. But far from everyone was ready to agree with this.
We may as well be frank here, as we know full well that many did not agree with what was happening, but some were unable by then to respond, and others were not yet ready to respond. The result though is that the system of international relations is in a feverish state and the global economy cannot extricate itself from systemic crisis. At the same time, rules and principles, in the economy and in politics, are constantly being distorted and we often see what only yesterday was taken as a truth and raised to dogma status reversed completely.
If the powers that be today find some standard or norm to their advantage, they force everyone else to comply. But if tomorrow these same standards get in their way, they are swift to throw them in the bin, declare them obsolete, and set or try to set new rules.
Thus, we saw the decisions to launch airstrikes in the centre of Europe, against Belgrade, and then came Iraq, and then Libya. The operations in Afghanistan also started without the corresponding decision from the United Nations Security Council. In their desire to shift the strategic balance in their favour these countries broke apart the international legal framework that prohibited deployment of new missile defence systems. They created and armed terrorist groups, whose cruel actions have sent millions of civilians into flight, made millions of displaced persons and immigrants, and plunged entire regions into chaos.
We see how free trade is being sacrificed and countries use sanctions as a means of political pressure, bypass the World Trade Organisation and attempt to establish closed economic alliances with strict rules and barriers, in which the main beneficiaries are their own transnational corporations. And we know this is happening. They see that they cannot resolve all of the problems within the WTO framework and so think, why not throw the rules and the organisation itself aside and build a new one instead. This illustrates what I just said.
At the same time, some of our partners demonstrate no desire to resolve the real international problems in the world today. In organisations such as NATO, for example, established during the Cold War and clearly out of date today, despite all the talk about the need to adapt to the new reality, no real adaptation takes place. We see constant attempts to turn the OSCE, a crucial mechanism for ensuring common European and also trans-Atlantic security, into an instrument in the service of someone‚Äôs foreign policy interests. The result is that this very important organisation has been hollowed out.
But they continue to churn out threats, imaginary and mythical threats such as the ‚ÄòRussian military threat‚Äô. This is a profitable business that can be used to pump new money into defence budgets at home, get allies to bend to a single superpower‚Äôs interests, expand NATO and bring its infrastructure, military units and arms closer to our borders.
Of course, it can be a pleasing and even profitable task to portray oneself as the defender of civilisation against the new barbarians. The only thing is that Russia has no intention of attacking anyone. This is all quite absurd. I also read analytical materials, those written by you here today, and by your colleagues in the USA and Europe.
It is unthinkable, foolish and completely unrealistic. Europe alone has 300 million people. All of the NATO members together with the USA have a total population of 600 million, probably. But Russia has only 146 million. It is simply absurd to even conceive such thoughts. And yet they use these ideas in pursuit of their political aims.
Another mythical and imaginary problem is what I can only call the hysteria the USA has whipped up over supposed Russian meddling in the American presidential election. The United States has plenty of genuinely urgent problems, it would seem, from the colossal public debt to the increase in firearms violence and cases of arbitrary action by the police.
You would think that the election debates would concentrate on these and other unresolved problems, but the elite has nothing with which to reassure society, it seems, and therefore attempt to distract public attention by pointing instead to supposed Russian hackers, spies, agents of influence and so forth.
I have to ask myself and ask you too: Does anyone seriously imagine that Russia can somehow influence the American people‚Äôs choice? America is not some kind of ‚Äòbanana republic‚Äô, after all, but is a great power. Do correct me if I am wrong.
The question is, if things continue in this vein, what awaits the world? What kind of world will we have tomorrow? Do we have answers to the questions of how to ensure stability, security and sustainable economic growth? Do we know how we will make a more prosperous world?
Sad as it is to say, there is no consensus on these issues in the world today. Maybe you have come to some common conclusions through your discussions, and I would, of course, be interested to hear them. But it is very clear that there is a lack of strategy and ideas for the future. This creates a climate of uncertainty that has a direct impact on the public mood.
Sociological studies conducted around the world show that people in different countries and on different continents tend to see the future as murky and bleak. This is sad. The future does not entice them, but frightens them. At the same time, people see no real opportunities or means for changing anything, influencing events and shaping policy.
Yes, formally speaking, modern countries have all the attributes of democracy: Elections, freedom of speech, access to information, freedom of expression. But even in the most advanced democracies the majority of citizens have no real influence on the political process and no direct and real influence on power.
People sense an ever-growing gap between their interests and the elite‚Äôs vision of the only correct course, a course the elite itself chooses. The result is that referendums and elections increasingly often create surprises for the authorities. People do not at all vote as the official and respectable media outlets advised them to, nor as the mainstream parties advised them to. Public movements that only recently were too far left or too far right are taking centre stage and pushing the political heavyweights aside.
At first, these inconvenient results were hastily declared anomaly or chance. But when they became more frequent, people started saying that society does not understand those at the summit of power and has not yet matured sufficiently to be able to assess the authorities‚Äô labour for the public good. Or they sink into hysteria and declare it the result of foreign, usually Russian, propaganda.
Friends and colleagues, I would like to have such a propaganda machine here in Russia, but regrettably, this is not the case. We have not even global mass media outlets of the likes of CNN, BBC and others. We simply do not have this kind of capability yet.
As for the claim that the fringe and populists have defeated the sensible, sober and responsible minority ‚Äì we are not talking about populists or anything like that but about ordinary people, ordinary citizens who are losing trust in the ruling class. That is the problem.
By the way, with the political agenda already eviscerated as it is, and with elections ceasing to be an instrument for change but consisting instead of nothing but scandals and digging up dirt ‚Äì who gave someone a pinch, who sleeps with whom, if you‚Äôll excuse me. This just goes beyond all boundaries. And honestly, a look at various candidates‚Äô platforms gives the impression that they were made from the same mould ‚Äì the difference is slight, if there is any.
It seems as if the elites do not see the deepening stratification in society and the erosion of the middle class, while at the same time, they implant ideological ideas that, in my opinion, are destructive to cultural and national identity. And in certain cases, in some countries they subvert national interests and renounce sovereignty in exchange for the favour of the suzerain.
This begs the question: who is actually the fringe? The expanding class of the supranational oligarchy and bureaucracy, which is in fact often not elected and not controlled by society, or the majority of citizens, who want simple and plain things ‚Äì stability, free development of their countries, prospects for their lives and the lives of their children, preserving their cultural identity, and, finally, basic security for themselves and their loved ones.
People are clearly scared to see how terrorism is evolving from a distant threat to an everyday one, how a terrorist attack could occur right near them, on the next street, if not on their own street, while any makeshift item ‚Äì from a home-made explosive to an ordinary truck ‚Äì can be used to carry out a mass killing.
Moreover, the terrorist attacks that have taken place in the past few years in Boston and other US cities, Paris, Brussels, Nice and German cities, as well as, sadly, in our own country, show that terrorists do not need units or organised structures ‚Äì they can act independently, on their own, they just need the ideological motivation against their enemies, that is, against you and us.
The terrorist threat is a clear example of how people fail to adequately evaluate the nature and causes of the growing threats. We see this in the way events in Syria are developing. No one has succeeded in stopping the bloodshed and launching a political settlement process. One would think that we would have begun to put together a common front against terrorism now, after such lengthy negotiations, enormous effort and difficult compromises.
But this has not happened and this common front has not emerged. My personal agreements with the President of the United States have not produced results either. There were people in Washington ready to do everything possible to prevent these agreements from being implemented in practice. This all demonstrates an unexplainable and I would say irrational desire on the part of the Western countries to keep making the same mistakes or, as we say here in Russia, keep stepping on the same rake.
We all see what is happening in Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya and a number of other countries. I have to ask, where are the results of the fight against terrorism and extremism? Overall, looking at the world as a whole, there are some results in particular regions and locations, but there is no global result and the terrorist threat continues to grow.
We all remember the euphoria in some capitals over the Arab Spring. Where are these fanfares today? Russia‚Äôs calls for a joint fight against terrorism go ignored. What‚Äôs more, they continue to arm, supply and train terrorist groups in the hope of using them to achieve their own political aims. This is a very dangerous game and I address the players once again: The extremists in this case are more cunning, clever and stronger than you, and if you play these games with them, you will always lose.
Colleagues, it is clear that the international community should concentrate on the real problems facing humanity today, the resolution of which will make our world a safer and more stable place and make the system of international relations fairer and more equal. As I said, it is essential to transform globalisation from something for a select few into something for all. It is my firm belief that we can overcome these threats and challenges only by working together on the solid foundation of international law and the United Nations Charter.
Today it is the United Nations that continues to remain an agency that is unparalleled in representativeness and universality, a unique venue for equitable dialogue. Its universal rules are necessary for including as many countries as possible in economic and humanitarian integration, guaranteeing their political responsibility and working to coordinate their actions while also preserving their sovereignty and development models.
We have no doubt that sovereignty is the central notion of the entire system of international relations. Respect for it and its consolidation will help underwrite peace and stability both at the national and international levels. There are many countries that can rely on a history stretching back a thousand years, like Russia, and we have come to appreciate our identity, freedom and independence. But we do not seek global domination, expansion or confrontation with anyone.
In our mind, real leadership lies in seeing real problems rather than attempting to invent mythical threats and use them to steamroll others. This is exactly how Russia understands its role in global affairs today.
There are priorities without which a prosperous future for our shared planet is unthinkable and they are absolutely obvious. I won‚Äôt be saying anything new here. First of all, there is equal and indivisible security for all states. Only after ending armed conflicts and ensuring the peaceful development of all countries will we be able to talk about economic progress and the resolution of social, humanitarian and other key problems. It is important to fight terrorism and extremism in actuality. It has been said more than once that this evil can only be overcome by a concerted effort of all states of the world. Russia continues to offer this to all interested partners.
It is necessary to add to the international agenda the issue of restoring the Middle Eastern countries‚Äô lasting statehood, economy and social sphere. The mammoth scale of destruction demands drawing up a long-term comprehensive programme, a kind of Marshall Plan, to revive the war- and conflict-ridden area. Russia is certainly willing to join actively in these team efforts.
We cannot achieve global stability unless we guarantee global economic progress. It is essential to provide conditions for creative labour and economic growth at a pace that would put an end to the division of the world into permanent winners and permanent losers. The rules of the game should give the developing economies at least a chance to catch up with those we know as developed economies. We should work to level out the pace of economic development, and brace up backward countries and regions so as to make the fruit of economic growth and technological progress accessible to all. Particularly, this would help to put an end to poverty, one of the worst contemporary problems.
It is also absolutely evident that economic cooperation should be mutually lucrative and rest on universal principles to enable every country to become an equal partner in global economic activities. True, the regionalising trend in the world economy is likely to persist in the medium term. However, regional trade agreements should complement and expand not replace the universal norms and regulations.
Russia advocates the harmonisation of regional economic formats based on the principles of transparency and respect for each other‚Äôs interests. That is how we arrange the work of the Eurasian Economic Union and conduct negotiations with our partners, particularly on coordination with the Silk Road Economic Belt project, which China is implementing. We expect it to promote an extensive Eurasian partnership, which promises to evolve into one of the formative centres of a vast Eurasian integration area. To implement this idea, 5+1 talks have begun already for an agreement on trade and economic cooperation between all participants in the process.
An important task of ours is to develop human potential. Only a world with ample opportunities for all, with highly skilled workers, access to knowledge and a great variety of ways to realise their potential can be considered truly free. Only a world where people from different countries do not struggle to survive but lead full lives can be stable.
A decent future is impossible without environment protection and addressing climate problems. That is why the conservation of the natural world and its diversity and reducing the human impact on the environment will be a priority for the coming decades.
Another priority is global healthcare. Of course, there are many problems, such as large-scale epidemics, decreasing the mortality rate in some regions and the like. So there is enormous room for advancement. All people in the world, not only the elite, should have the right to healthy, long and full lives. This is a noble goal. In short, we should build the foundation for the future world today by investing in all priority areas of human development. And of course, it is necessary to continue a broad-based discussion of our common future so that all sensible and promising initiatives are heard.
Colleagues, ladies and gentlemen, I am confident that you, as members of the Valdai Club, will actively take part in this work. Your expertise enables you to understand all angles of the processes underway both in Russia and in the world, forecast and evaluate long-term trends, and put forward new initiatives and recommendations that will help us find the way to the more prosperous and sustainable future that we all badly need.
Thank you very much for your attention.

"Users across Chinese social media expressed their anger and called for a boycott over a viral video of an Asian doctor being forcibly removed from a United Airlines flight this week. [The Wall Street Journal reports that China‚Äôs own Twitter clone and microblogging service Weibo lit up on Sunday night after the video was posted to the social media service. Within hours, the incident was the number one trending topic on the platform with 100, 000 comments and nearly 160 million views by Tuesday.  Many of the comments across Weibo focused on what many believed to be discrimination against the man based on his ethnicity. Chinese author Song Hongbing wrote, ‚ÄúThis is inherent arrogance  ‚Ä¶    I don‚Äôt think a    white doctor would be treated like this. ‚Äù Other Weibo users discussed boycotting the airline. Wang Guanxiong, a   investor, also posted his disapproval of the company on Weibo, saying, ‚ÄúOverselling is the responsibility of the airlines. Why was it an Asian who got beaten? This is purely racial discrimination  ‚Ä¶    boycott United Airlines. ‚Äù Oscar Munoz, the CEO of United Airlines apologized for the incident in an online statement, but later an internal memo reportedly sent to United employees was leaked that stated, ‚ÄúOur employees followed established procedures for dealing with situations like this,‚Äù China is quite a large market for United Airlines, who have operated in the country for more than 30 years, providing more nonstop routes to and from China than competitors such as American Airlines or Delta. The incident on United Airlines has sparked such a response from Chinese travellers due in part to the rise of China‚Äôs middle class, according to Linda Du, general manager at consultancy APCO Worldwide. ‚ÄúInternational travel is now really common for people, either for business or personal pleasure,‚Äù said Du. ‚Äú[Chinese consumers] want equal treatment, a good experience and to be respected. They have a sense of protecting  . ‚Äù Du also noted the use of social media to express anger over the incident as an example of the Chinese public using new media to make their voices heard: ‚ÄúIn China, most of the traditional media is regulated by the Chinese government, so social media ‚Äî  the   voice ‚Äî  is the only resource they have. ‚Äù In February is was reported that Weibo had 313 million active users each month, just slightly behind Twitter‚Äôs 319 million active monthly users. The service, which was developed as a clone of Twitter only for use in China, is expected to outgrow Jack Dorsey‚Äôs social media platform this year.

"America Is Better Without Borders Steven Hahn, TIME, November 1, 2016 
‚ÄúA nation without borders,‚Äù Donald Trump has warned us , ‚Äúis not a nation at all.‚Äù Trump was explaining the logic of the multi-billion dollar wall he promises to build along the U.S.-Mexican border, but he was hardly the first to make the case. Years ago, Ronald Reagan said much the same about the threat of illegal immigration, and others urging border vigilance have wrapped themselves in the high-flown rhetoric. Tee-shirts and coffee mugs have turned the idea into a saleable slogan. 
{snip} 
{snip} For much of its early history, the United States had hazy borders in good part because through war, conquest and diplomacy the country was constantly expanding and the shifting boundaries were not clearly marked. There was no agreement about how far west the Louisiana Territory reached or how far south the state of Texas stretched or how far north the Oregon Territory extended. Highly charged political words and brutal conflict followed (like the U.S.-Mexican War), while the imperial eyes of many leaders fell on Cuba, Central America and Hawaii. 
What‚Äôs more, the borders that were agreed upon were remarkably porous. Until well into the nineteenth century, immigrants could come and go at will and even participate in electoral politics if they simply declared an intention to become citizens; indeed, for decades it was not at all clear what a citizen of the United States was. The only international migration policed was the African slave trade, which Congress outlawed in 1808 after nearly half a million captives had been forcibly deposited on North American shores. 
{snip} 
It is easy, when politics and ethnocentrism serve, to proclaim the principle of the nation with borders as the nation itself, while the borders are, in fact, regularly traversed by policy makers, investors and moneyed interests pursuing the main chance and wielding the big stick. Trump himself regularly touts, though refuses to reveal, his international dealings, many of which confound his goal of keeping jobs within American borders if they don‚Äôt outright violate American laws. 
Truth is that the nation‚Äôs prosperity has long rested on the labor and resourcefulness of immigrants‚Äìvoluntary and involuntary, free and slave‚Äìand that those who most loudly denounce a ‚Äúnation without borders‚Äù are likely descendants of immigrants who were themselves harassed for their origins, faith and lifeways at some point in the past. We would do well to recognize that in a global economy such as ours, where the movement of people and goods are the lifeblood of our sustenance, a nation‚Äôs security is best maintained not by walling itself off but by lifting the prospects‚Äìand thereby creating political allies‚Äìof working people around the world.",Foregin,
"The international community should not only act against Venezuela‚Äôs socialist dictatorship as a matter of principle, but to protect the world from a growing web of criminal influence to which Venezuela belongs  ‚Äî   alongside Iran, Syria, Cuba, and North Korea. [So argues Diego Arria, a lifelong Venezuelan diplomat and former president of the UN Security Council who now advocates for the freedom of his country. In an interview with Breitbart News, conducted in both Spanish and English, Arria argues that the socialist Venezuelan government‚Äôs ties to terrorists, drug traffickers, and rogue states make it a threat to the global community, not merely its Latin American neighbors.  ‚ÄúVenezuela is a risk to international peace and security,‚Äù Arria argued. ‚ÄúVenezuela has extremely dangerous ties to groups in the Middle East, to Hezbollah, for example. Some say, ‚ÄòIran‚Äôs missiles can never reach the continental United States,‚Äô and I say, ‚Äòyes, but if they are in Venezuela, they can reach Miami directly. ‚Äô‚Äù ‚ÄúWe are associated with the worst causes of humanity,‚Äù Arria lamented. ‚ÄúWe were with [former Iranian president Mahmoud] Ahmadinejad in Iran, we had ties to [late Iraqi dictator Saddam] Hussein, we had them with [late Libyan dictator Muammar] Qaddafi, we have them with the Palestinians. Never have there been in Venezuela so many Palestinians serving in high positions in the Venezuelan political hierarchy. ‚Äù Venezuela may serve ‚Äúnot only as an occupation site for the Cubans,‚Äù Arria argues, ‚Äúbut for the Chinese, the Russians, the Indians, the Palestinians  ‚Ä¶     [this] turns Venezuela into an agitation center that is potentially very serious, and the United States has never given this the stature and importance that it should have for them. ‚Äù Arria also noted that Venezuela has close ties to the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) a Marxist   organization that in 2015 was considered the wealthiest   terrorist organization in the world, surpassed in wealth only by the Islamic State and Hamas. ‚ÄúThe relationship between Venezuela and the FARC in Colombia is extremely dangerous in my estimation because the FARC will soon be the most important and richest political party in Latin America. Those who do not enter the [President Juan Manuel] Santos pacification process will make of Venezuela an even greater drug and weapons transporting site than it is today. ‚Äù The ‚Äúpeace deal‚Äù between Santos‚Äô government and the FARC will allow the terrorist group to evolve into a political party, and most FARC members are likely to avoid prison time for their crimes. The government of dictator Nicol√°s Maduro maintains the close ties with Iran that his predecessor Hugo Ch√°vez cultivated, ties so close that Ahmadinejad risked a violation of sharia law to embrace Ch√°vez‚Äôs mother at his funeral and declared he would return to earth alongside Jesus Christ and the Imam Mahdi, the Shiite Muslim figure believed to be in hiding until the prophesied end of the world. The ties between Venezuela and Iran  ‚Äî   and its terror proxy, Hezbollah  ‚Äî   are so close that multiple reports have accused Venezuela of selling legal documents (birth certificates, passports, etc) to   citizen Shiite terrorists to grant them easier access to the Western hemisphere than their Middle Eastern passports would allow. Maduro has also kept ties with Palestinian leaders and Syrian dictator Bashar   whose   SANA news agency regularly publishes friendly diplomatic notes from Maduro. Maduro has enjoyed economic and political support from China and Russia, and North Korea‚Äôs state newspaper, the Rodong Sinmun, regularly publishes announcements that dictator Kim   has received accolades from socialist officials in the Latin American country. Venezuela‚Äôs closest ally, however, is Cuba  ‚Äî   a communist state with a history of gross disregard for human rights that has killed U. S. citizens engaging in humanitarian efforts and embraced U. S. fugitive murderers as ‚Äúrevolutionaries. ‚Äù Asked about the role the United States can play in weakening Venezuela‚Äôs socialist tyranny, Arria suggests there is little outside sanctions and frozen assets that the international community can do. ‚ÄúThe United States is playing a very interesting role, imposing sanctions on people tied to the regime, but they can do much more important things like following the money,‚Äù he proposed. ‚ÄúThe United States and the Europeans know perfectly where the money is that people tied to the regime keep‚Äù and can freeze it, he added, noting that Republican legislators like Florida‚Äôs Ileana   and Marco Rubio and New Jersey Senator Robert Menendez have proposed such measures. Should the international community act to freeze Chavista assets worldwide, they will count on a Latin America more convinced than ever of the evil of Maduro‚Äôs regime. ‚ÄúThere is a political change in Latin America, the countries who were the primary accomplices of the tyranny in Venezuela  ‚Äî   Brazil with Lula [da Silva] Argentina with [Cristina Fern√°ndez de] Kirchner  ‚Äî   [those governments] are not there anymore,‚Äù Arria noted. ‚ÄúThat has been of great importance because now we have two of the largest Latin American nations supporting our efforts to recapture liberty. This is a notable change. ‚Äù Even Mexico, Arria added, a nation with what he identified as a ‚Äúvery accommodating policy of ‚Äù has ‚Äúbroken with this policy and categorically pronounced itself on Venezuela. ‚Äù ‚ÄúToday we have Mexico, Brazil, Argentina, Colombia, about 90 percent of Latin America repudiates and condemns the Venezuelan regime,‚Äù he noted. With the support of the Organization of American State (OAS) and a few unforced errors from the Maduro regime, Arria sees an unprecedented chance to recapture the country from the socialists. ‚ÄúThis is the largest peaceful insurrection in the history of Venezuela,‚Äù he notes. ‚ÄúIn Latin America, we have never seen for 42 days straight 1, 000 protests, 20 daily. And it is not just in Caracas, it is in many towns. Every time they kill a young [protester] more mothers, fathers, siblings show up. ‚Äù Follow Frances Martel on Facebook and Twitter.",Foregin,
"In an effort to give back to his hometown community in Florida, Carol City, the   star Rick Ross decided to fulfill a childhood dream: He bought a Checkers   franchise. Why a Checkers? One reason seemed to rise above them all. ‚ÄúThe No. 1 fries in the game,‚Äù Mr. Ross says in a   video released in December. The video shows Mr. Ross driving around town in his Ford truck, puffing cigars and relating stories from his childhood in the downtrodden community, which is in the Miami area. At a certain point, Mr. Ross begins talking about the burger joint he frequented as a teenager, across the thoroughfare from the carwash where he worked. There was a McDonald‚Äôs that was closer, but Checkers, he says, was more affordable. ‚ÄúI made $30 a day from 8 in the morning to 8 at night,‚Äù Mr. Ross says. ‚ÄúI went to Checkers. ‚Äù Checkers does not typically pursue celebrity endorsements. But when Mr. Ross applied to purchase the Carol City franchise last summer, he seemed so genuine in his affection for the   chain that Checkers recognized a marketing opportunity as straightforward as a  . Still, it did not want a typical campaign. Scott Wakeman, director of marketing for Checkers   Restaurants Inc. and the company‚Äôs ad firm, Fitzgerald  Company in Atlanta, turned to the    digital media upstart Woven Digital. The firm has heavy traction among Mr. Ross‚Äôs primary audience  ‚Äî   young men  ‚Äî   on the entertainment sites that it owns, like Uproxx, Dime and BroBible. Woven has also specialized in   productions that, on the surface, do not feel like ads. To Mr. Wakeman, it seemed like a perfect way to take advantage of Mr. Ross‚Äôs charisma and authenticity. ‚ÄúIt just felt like such a unique opportunity,‚Äù he said. The video, which is 3 minutes 31 seconds long, was filmed over two days in Carol City in late September, mostly as Mr. Ross drove his truck around. Spliced in is footage of pickup basketball games and bikers popping wheelies. The first mention of Checkers comes about halfway through the video. Checkers invests the bulk of its annual marketing budget, about $20 million, in standard television spots, Mr. Wakeman said. By contrast, the Rick Ross ad has been distributed only on social media channels and Uproxx. But Mr. Wakeman said he believed the unusual authenticity of the video  ‚Äî   and the compelling way Mr. Ross related his story  ‚Äî   would resonate with viewers more than anything Checkers had tried in the past. ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt think of it as an advertisement,‚Äù Mr. Wakeman said, adding of Mr. Ross, ‚ÄúWe wanted to create a piece of content that captured his love for the brand. ‚Äù Last year, Woven teamed up with MillerCoors on a series of short documentary videos that profiled entrepreneurs with expertise in making items like watches and surfboards, or, in one case, doing calligraphy. The   series, sponsored by Coors Banquet beer and run across Uproxx, was intended to reach an audience that has become adept at avoiding traditional advertising. According to Brad Feinberg, senior director of media and digital marketing for MillerCoors, it was a success, receiving more than 33 million views. ‚ÄúThis is content that people want to see they‚Äôre intrigued by it, they seek it out,‚Äù Mr. Feinberg said. ‚ÄúAnd putting it in long form is something you can do in the digital space that is very cost prohibitive in other places. ‚Äù   storytelling might sound incompatible with the   attention spans of millennials, but it can have its advantages. Young men in particular have demonstrated a willingness to sit through longer pieces of content if it aligns with their values and gives them something of value in return, said Leah Swartz, senior content specialist for FutureCast, a part of the Barkley agency of Kansas City, Mo. that focuses on research into millennials. Her team considers this a rewriting of the old ABCs of sales. Rather than the mantra ‚Äúalways be closing,‚Äù brands must now think about how they can ‚Äúalways be helping. ‚Äù ‚ÄúYou have to think about helping your consumer, what you‚Äôre providing, what benefits you‚Äôre giving, how you‚Äôre making their lives more fulfilled,‚Äù Ms. Swartz said. For Checkers, turning a story about a hit rapper‚Äôs upbringing into a selling point for hamburgers and chicken wings was a bit of a gamble, Mr. Wakeman said. In the video, there are only a couple of references to Checkers‚Äô products, such as Mr. Ross‚Äôs unequivocal praise of the French fries. But Mr. Wakeman said the documentary format allowed Mr. Ross‚Äôs true voice to shine through. ‚ÄúFood and value are our two big brand pillars, and I think they come through in the spot, in a cool way,‚Äù Mr. Wakeman said. ‚ÄúIt wasn‚Äôt a script. It was just Rick talking about what he loves‚Äù about the place. The video also captures moments of spontaneity. The producers originally intended just to film Mr. Ross outside the Checkers, but on the way there, he sent out a message on Instagram offering free burgers to any fans who wanted to meet him in Carol City. About 200 people showed up, and the cameras rolled as he shook hands and ripped open bags of food. Benjamin Blank, the chief executive of Woven, said the company was not trying to conceal that the video was an advertisement. But he said he thought the content itself was meaningful and captivating enough that   viewers ultimately would not mind being sold to. ‚ÄúThere were plenty of things Rick could have gotten involved with from a business standpoint,‚Äù Mr. Blank said. ‚ÄúBut his reason for getting involved with Checkers was a great story. ‚Äù",Foregin,
"VIDEOS Oil has been spilling into the Pacific Ocean since last month and its being totally ignored This is in the heart of the Great Bear Rainforest, which is seen as ‚Äúone of the most pristine wilderness environments on earth‚Äù By Chris ""Kikila"" Perrin - Friday, November 18, 2016 8:53 AM EST 
Bella Bella, British Columbia ‚Äî When is environmental damage too much? When is it acceptable? In what is being called ‚Äú a relatively tiny ‚Äù marine oil spill, for the Heiltsuk First Nations of the Central Coast of BC, the question is being asked in quite real terms, forcing government to answer the questions that it might have preferred to have evaded. 
Since running aground in mid-October , a small boat has been leaking oil into the Pacific Ocean, and along BC‚Äôs Central Coast. Despite the fact that this spill comes in the aftermath of the Royal Visit to the region ‚Äî a visit that sought to place the health of the coastline and all the life that dwells there within the global lens ‚Äî there appears to be very little international interest. Making matters worse, there appears to be little interest from Canadian lawmakers on how best to reduce the potential for disasters like this. 
Along the Central Coast of British Columbia, the Great Bear Rainforest is seen as ‚Äúone of the most pristine wilderness environments on earth.‚Äù Stretching approximately 400 kilometers along this sparsely populated area, the Great Bear Rainforest has long represented the very idea of conservation and intrinsic preservation to Canadians and environmentalists around the world. 
Along with the Kermode Bear , the area made National Geographic‚Äôs ‚Äú Places of a Lifetime ‚Äù list and has been called the planet‚Äôs last large expanse of coastal temperate rain forest by people like Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. Natural beauty, conservation projects , and provincial parks are not, however, all the region is known for. 
Of all things, the Central Coast offers access to the Pacific Ocean. It also provides a more-or-less direct line for fossil fuel exportation from various LNG (liquefied natural gas) sites around the province, as well as tar sands oil from the neighbouring province of Alberta. 
North of Bella Bella, the town of Kitimat serves as the proposed terminal destination of Enbridge‚Äôs Northern Gateway Pipeline , a project that has seen a great deal of protest that, in many ways, echoes the issues coming to a head in Cannon Ball, North Dakota. One of the most attractive aspects of the region, insofar as fossil fuel extraction is concerned, is the access it offers to Asian markets , pitting the desires of big oil corporations against those of First Nations and environmentalists , alike. 
Even with the legislative death of Northern Gateway, the region continues to be the focal point for resource extraction. October‚Äôs oil spill ‚Äî which is ongoing ‚Äî provides a visceral reminder of what is at stake in such discussions, pushing many local residents to demand a full tanker ban along the Central Coast . 
Yet, while the Coastal Rainforest is inundated with thousands of litres of oil, the federal government seems content to remain reactive . Rather than agreeing to the suggested ban, the Liberal government of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau instead proposed a $1.5 billion (CDN) fund to help deal with oil spills after they occur. 
Reactive policies like this leave the fragile ecosystems found in the Central Coast region to suffer contamination before they are dealt with, and offer no change for the way issues of sovereignty are evaluated between First Nations and the colonial Canadian government. 
Since his election in 2015, PM Trudeau has taken several quick steps back from his promises to respect First Nations‚Äô sovereignty and deal with environmental issues . Although this ‚Äú relatively tiny marine oil spill‚Äù can be seen as just that, a minor environmental issue that will be cleaned up with more federal money, there is a deeper implication that can be seen ‚Äî one that pits ongoing environmental degradation and cultural assimilation and genocide against neoliberal economic policy .",Foregin,
"
In today‚Äôs, 25th, Wikileaks release of hacked Podesta emails, one of the notable highlights is a March 2, 2015 exchange between John Podesta and Clinton aide Cheryl Mills in which the Clinton Campaign Chair says ‚ÄúOn another matter‚Ä¶.and not to sound like Lanny, but we are going to have to dump all those emails.‚Äù 
The email, which may indicate intent , was sent just days before the NYT story revealing the existence of Hillary‚Äôs email server, and Hillary‚Äôs press conference addressing what was at the time, the stunning revelation that she had a personal email account, and server, in her home.
Mills‚Äô response: ‚ÄúThink you just got your new nick name.‚Äù
It is unclear which Lanny is referred to: the infamous former DOJ staffer Lanny Breuer who quit in January 2013 after telling Frontline that some banks are too big to fail, or, more likely Lanny Davis , special counsel to President Bill Clinton, and spokesperson for the President and the White House on matters concerning campaign-finance investigations and other legal issues.
It is also unclear for now which emails Podesta is referring to in the thread, but Podesta adds: ‚Äúbetter to do so sooner than later.‚Äù We can hope that a subsequent response, yet to be leaked by Wikileaks, will provide more color.
If the exchange is shown to disclose intent to mislead, it will negate the entire narrative prepared by Clinton that she merely deleted ‚Äúpersonal‚Äù emails and will reveal a strategic plan to hinder the State Department and FBI ‚Äúinvestigation.‚Äù
This is the first time that particular exchange has emerged among the Podesta emails.

And in a separate email sent out just days later by Clinton campaign communications director, Jennifer Palmieri, we get yet another confirmation that the president actively mislead the public when he said he didn‚Äôt know Hillary was using a private email address:
Suggest Philippe talk to Josh or Eric. They know POTUS and HRC emailed . Josh has been asked about that. Standard practice is not to confirm anything about his email, so his answer to press was that he would not comment/confirm. I recollect that Josh was also asked if POTUS ever noticed her personal email account and he said something like POTUS likely had better things to do than focus on his Cabinet‚Äôs email addresses.
Perhaps while the DOJ/FBI is taking a second look into Huma Abedin‚Äôs emails, it can also take a repeat look at some of these, especially the ones involving POTUS. Delivered by The Daily Sheeple

From one libtard to the next, promises of work-free lives filled with food stamp steak and lobster flew amid delusional dreams of free college education for everyone and a health care system that will cure what ails you for eleven bucks a month, no questions asked. The $15 minimum wage and 90 percent tax on the people who have done well in America were celebrated with great vigor, until it came time for the woman of the hour herself to take the stage. 
Bruce Springsteen, acting as master of ceremonies, shouted over the roar of the feminist-laden crowd, ‚ÄúHere she is, and I‚Äôm with her!‚Äù Unfortunately, she never appeared in the spotlight. 
Springsteen, after holding a finger to his earpiece, picked up his acoustic guitar and started slowly picking away a familiar tune. He turned to the audience and said:

Dr. David Duke and Dr. Slattery Expose Hillary‚Äôs Treason and Why Trump & Duke will Win! 
Today Dr. Duke and Dr. Slattery talked about Hillary‚Äôs clear acts of treason against the United States by providing massive shipments of weapons to Saudi Arabia at a time that she knew they were providing support to ISIS. Dr. Duke, if elected to the Senate, would be in a position to expose Hillary and push for her impeachment should she win (steal) the election. BLOOD ON THE TRAITOR‚ÄôS HANDS! 
Dr. Slattery discussed post-election scenarios. He noted that if Trump wins in a close election, a small number of Republican electors could be bribed to vote for Hillary, throwing the election to her, or even vote for Pence, throwing the election to the House of Representatives to decide from amongst Trump, Hillary, and Pence. Should Hillary win and Trump supporters feel the election was illegitimate, impeachment would be more likely.

"Hillary Clinton longs for the days when Americans knew how to execute a covert action abroad and not spill the details to reporters. Addressing a Goldman Sachs event in 2013, in one of the speeches that WikiLeaks published on Saturday, Mrs. Clinton gave a   realpolitik answer to the question of how to handle a problem like Syria. If the best chance of success was to act secretly inside that country, she made clear, she had no problem doing that. She went on to say  ‚Äî   as her audience already knew because of revelations in the news media  ‚Äî   that as secretary of state she had advocated secretly arming the Syrian opposition and moving forcefully to counter the Russians, who at that point were supporting President Bashar   but had not yet fully entered the conflict. ‚ÄúMy view was you intervene as covertly as is possible for Americans to intervene,‚Äù she said in answer to a question from Lloyd C. Blankfein, the chief executive of Goldman Sachs, which paid Mrs. Clinton about $225, 000 a speech to give what felt like an insider‚Äôs view of the making of American foreign policy, months after she left office. But she quickly acknowledged that ‚Äúwe used to be much better at this than we are now. ‚Äù ‚ÄúNow, you know, everybody can‚Äôt help themselves,‚Äù she added, and officials go out to ‚Äútell their friendly reporters and somebody else: ‚ÄòLook what we‚Äôre doing, and I want credit for it. ‚Äô‚Äù The three hacked speeches from 2013 that WikiLeaks published, most likely with Russian government assistance, help explain how Mrs. Clinton approaches some of the world‚Äôs knottiest problems. They are a reminder of the   way she often assesses her most vexing opponents when the television cameras are not on. By the time she left office that year, she had met and assessed two of the three world leaders who were determined most prominently to challenge the United States: President Xi Jinping of China, whom she clearly admires President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, whom she clearly detests (and who has returned the sentiment this election) and Kim   of North Korea, whose determination to build a nuclear weapon and missiles that could ‚Äúreach Hawaii and the West Coast, theoretically‚Äù poses a risk ‚Äúwe cannot abide,‚Äù she said. At moments in the speeches, Mrs. Clinton was cleareyed about how difficult it would be to execute some of the actions she advocated, including a   zone over parts of Syria. ‚ÄúTo have a   zone, you have to take out all of the air defense, many of which are located in populated areas,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúSo our missiles, even if they are standoff missiles so we‚Äôre not putting our pilots at risk  ‚Äî   you‚Äôre going to kill a lot of Syrians. So all of a sudden this intervention that people talk about so glibly becomes an American and NATO involvement where you take a lot of civilians. ‚Äù Her assessment of the risk came before she was formally running for president. But two years later, in a television interview in October 2015, she sounded willing to take that risk. ‚ÄúI personally would be advocating now for a   zone and humanitarian corridors to stop the carnage on the ground and from the air, to try to provide some way to take stock of what‚Äôs happening, to try to stem the flow of refugees,‚Äù she said. Her successor as secretary of state, John Kerry, tried last month to open those humanitarian corridors, but the effort collapsed in a dispute with Russia. A push to get it restarted during a meeting in Lausanne, Switzerland, on Saturday between Mr. Kerry and his Russian counterpart, Sergey V. Lavrov, also failed. In the talks at Goldman Sachs, Mrs. Clinton was often more analytic than prescriptive, describing her perceptions of individual leaders and the domestic politics and foreign threats they face. In that regard, her approach is quite different from that of Donald J. Trump. In two interviews on foreign policy with The New York Times, one in March and another in July, Mr. Trump moved directly to his plans of action: bombing the Islamic State and taking oil, for example, or withdrawing troops from Europe and Asia if allies do not pay their share. While Mr. Trump often talks in terms of striking deals, Mrs. Clinton talks in the more traditional terms of  . When she became secretary in 2009, she posed a question about China to an Australian leader: ‚ÄúHow do you deal toughly with your banker?‚Äù In the Goldman transcript, she suggested that she had answered her own question when sparring with the Chinese over its claims in the South China Sea. ‚ÄúI made the point at one point in the argument that, you know, you can call it whatever you want to call it,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt have a claim to all of it. I said, by that argument, you know, the United States should claim all of the Pacific. We liberated it, we defended it. We have as much claim to all of the Pacific. And we could call it the American Sea, and it could go from the West Coast of California all the way to the Philippines. ‚Äù ‚ÄúAnd, you know, my counterpart sat up very straight and goes, ‚ÄòWell, you can‚Äôt do that. ‚Äô‚Äù Mrs. Clinton segued into an evaluation of Mr. Xi, the Chinese leader, who she noted had consolidated power in a way his predecessor never did, but had quickly traveled to places like Russia and Africa to assuage ‚Äúdoubts about Chinese practices. ‚Äù ‚ÄúSo he‚Äôs someone who you at least have the impression is a more worldly, somewhat more experienced politician,‚Äù she said. Mr. Xi has since become more aggressive in the South China Sea, and it is unclear how forcefully Mrs. Clinton, if she became president, would confront him over his claims. She acknowledged at one point that the administration had gotten distracted from its ‚Äúpivot‚Äù to Asia. In North Korea, the situation has worsened much more drastically. She summarized the Chinese message to the North Koreans this way: ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt care if you occasionally shoot off a missile. That‚Äôs good. That upsets the Americans and causes them heartburn, but you can‚Äôt keep going down a path that is unpredictable. ‚Äù That, of course, is exactly the path they have gone down.",Foregin,

"Turkish Objections Won't Stop YPG's Involvement by Jason Ditz, October 26, 2016 Share This 
US Lt. Gen. Stephen Townsend, the leader of the US military forces in Iraq and Syria , today announced that Kurdish YPG forces will participate in the invasion of the ISIS capital city of Raqqa, despite Turkish government demands that the Kurds not be allowed to take part. 
Townsend was a bit vague on the details of Kurdish involvement, saying the US are ‚Äúgoing to take this in steps,‚Äù and that Turkey has to realize the only way that the US is going to have enough force to take over Raqqa any time soon is with a significant portion of the YPG involved. 
Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu reiterated that his government wants only ‚Äúlocal forces‚Äù involved in the Raqqa battle, and that the YPG, who Turkey considers a terrorist organization, must not be allowed to take part in any way. 
Turkey‚Äôs military has been attacking the YPG in several locations around Syria over the past week, including heavy airstrikes which killed an estimated 200 YPG fighters who were engaged in an offensive against ISIS around Afrin. The Turkish government has repeatedly complained the YPG is gaining too much territory in Syria, and that they must abandon much of it. Last 5 posts by Jason Ditz",Foregin,
"in: Consciousness , Government Corruption , Society , Special Interests , US News No event in American history (if you ask me) has been more engineered, more anticipated and more built up than the upcoming November 8, 2016 presidential election. Face it. This presidential election season made the truth movement mainstream. Evil and corruption was brought into the light. We‚Äôve observed what a George Soros-like engineered regime breakdown looks and feels like from the inside, our side this time. We had heard and read about all those foreign governments that the US overthrew with their ‚Äúdemocracy‚Äù tactics using ‚Äúspecial forces‚Äù, NGO‚Äôs, paid-for revolutionaries, activists and in some cases flat out murderous fighters (ISIS, moderate rebels). This time the engineered chaos was happening here in the US. This 2016 election season has been packed with outright exposed corruption, lies, propaganda, murders, stolen primaries, fabricated accusations, distractions, staged debates and much more. We have seen a criminally accused presidential candidate get away with crimes in broad daylight while suspected of suffering from Parkinson‚Äôs disease, passing out, having seizures and even being followed around by a creepy doctor with a seizure medication injector. This is the stuff Hollywood films are made of. The list of the insanity goes on and on, right? We‚Äôve witnessed plenty of lies, propaganda and Jerry Springer show-like attacks by the candidates to create just the perfect smokescreen so that Americans are not looking into the events in Aleppo or Mosul much less the Hillary-DNC- mainstream media corruption scandals and revelations. Instead of keeping a close eye on the doings of the US criminal empire, the elite relied on a very in-your-face and increasingly arrogant, defiant and now very busted and discredited mainstream media to push the desired paradigm and reinforce it every which way they can. Actually, this understates the situation. What really happened was that the mainstream media joined forces with the chosen candidate of the ruling oligarchs (Hillary) and together their campaign (the DNC-Hillary-Soros-Moveon.org-Michael Moore-Hollywood-mainstream media complex) has brought us to the ending that truth seekers are now looking ahead to with great anxiety and anticipation. Actually, I‚Äôm understating the situation again. All or most Americans (awakened or not) are anticipating and anxiously awaiting the end results of the US presidential elections. The question we should all be asking then is, how did we get here? Oh, and perhaps more importantly, where are we going? And to answer this, one must realize that the ruling elite have plans. They have a lot of money and they have players willing to go along with their plans. Not sure of this? Then please research Sandy Hook or Boston bombing events. Or research many of the crisis actor events of the past few years. That‚Äôs right. While they were staging one event after another, too many Americans were too busy and too afraid to call these fake events for what they were. Too many Americans fell for the trick that we were supposed to believe mainstream media ‚Äústories‚Äù and narratives unless we could ‚Äúprove‚Äù that the account didn‚Äôt happen the way mainstream media said it did. In other words, many Americans were tricked into believing that unless proven otherwise, we should BELIEVE mainstream media. Well here we are in October of 2016 and finally (though it has been common knowledge to many of us for a long while) the illegitimacy of the mainstream media is carved in stone. No longer can it be considered a ‚Äúconspiracy‚Äù by anyone, that mainstream media is corrupt and acts as a tool of psychological terrorism against the public on behalf of the ruling elite. That said, now it is time to confront the fully engineered and long planned ending of this 2016 US presidential election. Will staged ‚Äú political terrorism ‚Äú, a term just introduced a couple of weeks ago into the American psyche, be staged as Mike Adams at Natural News is writing about ? Will this ‚Äúterrorism‚Äù or planned ‚Äúevent‚Äù mark the beginning of the end of America? If so, what will happen? How will it all go down? Many are now wondering how deep is this web of corruption and how far will the traitors identified before us be willing to go to destroy America? The one thing everyone should accept is that this ending has been planned just like so many ‚Äúevents‚Äù of the past several years have been scripted and planned. So today I invite readers to acknowledge this very important singular factor in today‚Äôs events. The fact that they are planned. The notion of organic and spontaneous results is something the ruling elite hate. They hate anything that is organic, spontaneous, unpredictable, people-powered, natural and real. They need everything to be controlled, scripted, planned, orchestrated, engineered. Do you see a pattern here? One consciousness longs for freedom, naturalness and spontaneity, the other longs to control, orchestrate, engineer and dictate the ending, like a master would want to control his slave. Understanding this fundamental contrast between the control freak consciousness (think ruling elite) and the free spirited consciousness desiring to simply be free, will allow you to see what‚Äôs coming this November 8th 2016. What‚Äôs coming is a long awaited day for which the ruling elite have paid a lot of money and hired many people to manipulate and control the ending of. So the real question is, will their operation succeed? Looking at the election day ending from a birds-eye view and seeing how the ruling elite think and operate it is not difficult to see that they too are waiting for that day so that they can implement whatever plan they‚Äôll need based on the materializing reality at that moment. In this (what I‚Äôll call) wait-and-see plan whose execution of plan will either be entirely controlled from the beginning or be an adjusting reaction-based plan to be determined by the emerging reality, we can be sure that at no point will the ruling elite accept an ending that ruins their plan. In other words they will adjust their plan as often and as desperately as possible and necessary to engineer an ending to their liking. This ultimately is all we need to know to plan our (truth seekers and freedom lovers) next move. And our next move should look something like this if you ask me: 1- Have a plan including options for self-sustaining yourself and your loved ones (food, water, shelter and other personal needs) 2- Expect corruption but continue fighting and exposing the perpetrators. Let‚Äôs not let one of these traitors (including crisis actors and operatives working for the state) get away with what they have done. 3- Don‚Äôt rely ONLY on the internet to keep track of developing events. You might want to write down current event information or better yet print out key articles and documents (proof). Also download important videos don‚Äôt assume these videos will always be available on YouTube or the internet. Remember we are entering a much more volatile and intense information war age. The main point is we need to archive the evidence against those criminals who have betrayed America and humanity. 4- Beware of layered psychological operations. Question everything you hear and don‚Äôt discount that some ‚Äúnews‚Äù is designed for you to hear it (get it?). Unfortunately the controllers have indeed upped the anti when it comes to the information war. In deceptive times like these grabbing on to the principles you believe in become much more important than agreeing with someone on every little nuance about a particular event. Stay oriented and remember who the bad guys are, especially as we see the Hillary-mainstream media complex laughably blaming Russian president Vladimir Putin for all the now-revealed corruption and criminality of the Clintons, the mainstream media, the DNC and many others. Now is the time to confront the very real and very relevant inherent concepts of truth versus lies, lightness versus darkness, freedom versus slavery and knowledge versus hidden knowledge (the occult) because this, my friends, is what we are dealing with. We (truth seekers) are all in this together. We didn‚Äôt ask to be put in this show, it sort of came to us. Perhaps we (awakened humanity) are fulfilling a role that we cannot fully understand. This species we call humans needs some members of it‚Äôs kind to save the rest of the species and if you are reading this then you are probably a chosen vessel in this battle for humanity. There is nothing to fear for the ending has surely been scripted. We (like them) will also respond in real-time in the most effective way possible. What we need to do more than anything else is ‚Ä¶. (pay attention) ‚Ä¶ think ahead just like they do. And so today I‚Äôm thinking ahead. I have plans for both scenarios (Trump or Hillary declared victory). I have plans for no ‚Äúpolitical terrorism‚Äù and political terrorism, shock or no shock, chaos or no chaos. In my world the problem remains the same until we hold these corrupt ruling elite, their politicians and players all responsible for their criminality and corruption. Plain and simple, the ruling elite must be identified, stopped and held accountable for their crimes against humanity and the US constitution. This is more important than any presidential election. Will a Trump victory make this accountability more possible? Many are hopeful of this but ultimately we must find a way to impose our will on the future and not rely on a politician to do this for us. Finally, I‚Äôm reminded of the very last line of the film ‚Äò The American Dream ‚Äò when the villain asks ‚Äúwhat do you think this is?‚Äù and the answer ‚Äúthis is AMERICA!!‚Äù. Likewise, let‚Äôs remember, this IS America, the politically hijacked land that guarantees each and every individual inherent rights which are clearly and indisputably outlined in the US constitution. Will an opportunity present itself for the rule of law to be restored or will the ruling elite have their way? That question will very likely be answered at a time not necessarily coinciding with election night. This is a reminder to all that the battle we face for humanity and truth is continuous and very long term not about one isolated moment or day. Submit your review",Foregin,

"The summer light was fading to gold near Red Square as Oliver Stone maneuvered through the lobby bar of a   Moscow hotel last year. He walked past the marble staircase and the grand piano to a table in the back. A group of businessmen in suits lingered nearby. Stone grimaced. ‚ÄúI think we should move,‚Äù he said. His producer, Moritz Borman, led the way to another corner. ‚ÄúHow‚Äôs this?‚Äù Borman asked. Stone didn‚Äôt answer. He eyed an older couple slurping soup and kept moving. A moment later, Stone finally settled in by a window, comfortably beyond earshot of the other patrons. Such security precautions had become routine. Ever since Stone decided to make a biopic about Edward Snowden, the American   blower currently holed up in Moscow somewhere, the director  ‚Äî   who became a Buddhist while making ‚ÄúHeaven  Earth‚Äù and sampled a buffet of psychedelic drugs for ‚ÄúThe Doors‚Äù  ‚Äî   had gone all method again. On ‚ÄúSnowden,‚Äù he and Borman became so preoccupied with American government surveillance that they had their Los Angeles offices swept for bugs more than once. The director hadn‚Äôt been sleeping well. Principal photography wrapped a month earlier, and now Stone had come to Moscow to film Snowden for the movie‚Äôs grand finale. He ordered a decaf coffee and began to lay out the events that led him and Borman to be hanging out in Russian hotels, on the lookout for potential spies. ‚ÄúLast January, Moritz calls me,‚Äù Stone said. ‚ÄúHe says: ‚ÄòYou got a call from this fella who represents Mr. Snowden. You‚Äôre invited to Moscow. ‚Äô‚Äôu2009‚Äù The call had come from Anatoly Kucherena, Snowden‚Äôs Russian lawyer. In the course of his career, Kucherena has represented Russian oligarchs, film directors, a few pop singers and a state minister. In 2012, he campaigned for Vladimir V. Putin, and soon after Snowden landed in Moscow, Kucherena showed up at Sheremetyevo Airport and offered his services. Then Kucherena wrote a novel about his new client. Titled ‚ÄúTime of the Octopus,‚Äù it follows a National Security Agency leaker named Joshua Cold who is marooned in the airport and the Russian advocate who liberates him. In January 2014, months before the book was published, Kucherena called Borman to see if Stone might like to make it into a Hollywood movie. ‚ÄúAnd I know you from working on, what, three films?‚Äù Stone said at the bar. ‚ÄúFive,‚Äù Borman said. At the time, Stone and Borman were barely speaking after a   out during the making of ‚ÄúSavages,‚Äù a beachy Blake Lively thriller. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve had our fights,‚Äù Stone said. ‚ÄúYou know, he‚Äôs German I‚Äôm American. ‚Äù He didn‚Äôt elaborate. ‚ÄúHe calls, and I go: ‚ÄòOh, [expletive]. Not again,‚Äô‚Äôu2009‚Äù Stone continued. It wasn‚Äôt just about Borman. Stone wanted nothing to do with another political docudrama. He spent two decades trying to get a biopic about the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. off the ground, only to see ‚ÄúSelma‚Äù get made to critical acclaim. Then there was the My Lai massacre film. Merrill Lynch put up cash, Bruce Willis was set to star and Stone built an entire village in Thailand. As the economy collapsed in 2008, the financing evaporated. ‚ÄúYou get these scars, and they don‚Äôt go away,‚Äù Stone said. So Stone was skeptical. But this was Snowden, who   handedly exposed the colossal scale on which the United States had been surveilling its citizens. Plus, the director needed a hit. After early successes like ‚ÄúPlatoon‚Äù and ‚ÄúWall Street,‚Äù his more recent films didn‚Äôt receive the attention he hoped. The Snowden story had all the ingredients of an epic Stone picture: politics, government conspiracy and, at the center of it all, an American patriot who had lost faith. If it panned out, it could be Stone‚Äôs millennial   up to ‚ÄúBorn on the Fourth of July,‚Äù the Ron Kovic biopic that won him an Oscar in 1990. But first Stone and Borman had to make sure Kucherena was for real. Borman asked the lawyer to send the book and two   tickets to Moscow. Both arrived the next day. In case they still had doubts, Kucherena‚Äôs office gave Borman a number to call. On the other end was an employee of the Russian consulate in San Francisco, who turned out to be a big fan of ‚ÄúThe Life of David Gale,‚Äù a film Borman produced. They were issued visas that same week. (Kucherena denies buying   tickets for Stone and Borman or helping expedite their visas.) ‚ÄúWhen that happened,‚Äù Borman said, ‚ÄúI thought, O. K. I guess Kucherena can pull the strings. ‚Äù As   narratives go, Snowden‚Äôs is a compelling one. His transformation from a shy and pale   something  ‚Äî   full of the sort of idealism those years can afford  ‚Äî   to political dissident made him a hero figure to   establishment liberals who are in the business of storytelling. Raised in a family of federal employees, Snowden grew up near Fort Meade, Md. He enlisted in the Army, went to work for the Central Intelligence Agency and became a technology specialist for the N. S. A. By the summer of 2013, he had downloaded thousands of documents, taken off for Hong Kong and asked the journalists Glenn Greenwald and Laura Poitras to meet him there. The initial revelations were sensational. Not only had the N. S. A. been monitoring the calls, emails and web activity of millions of Americans, but it also had been tapping into the networks of Google, Yahoo and other companies to do so. The Guardian published the leaks, and Greenwald eventually revealed the identity of his source in a video shot by Poitras. Depending on your feelings about national security, the N. S. A. ‚Äôs actions were either necessary or unconstitutional. The Apple   founder Steve Wozniak called Snowden a hero. Secretary of State John Kerry called him a traitor. Donald Trump called for his execution. As Snowden became a celebrity, a cause and a historical event, the web of people who wanted to take part in it widened. Most had his best interests in mind, but his story also happened to advance agendas that had long needed an appealing spokesperson.   liberties lawyers wanted to represent him. Activist journalists wanted access to him. Publishers rushed out books, including ‚ÄúThe Snowden Files: The Inside Story of the World‚Äôs Most Wanted Man,‚Äù by Luke Harding of The Guardian, and ‚ÄúThe Snowden Operation: Inside the West‚Äôs Greatest Intelligence Disaster,‚Äù by Edward Lucas of The Economist. Despite promising an ‚Äúinside‚Äù look, neither writer had ever met Snowden. Those with intimate knowledge documented the experience, too. In 2014, Greenwald published ‚ÄúNo Place to Hide: Edward Snowden, the N. S. A. and the U. S. Surveillance State,‚Äù a dramatic retelling of how Greenwald broke the story. That fall, Poitras released ‚ÄúCitizenfour,‚Äù a tense and spooky documentary about a modest and intelligent young man who hid under a blanket when typing on his laptop. (It won the 2015 Oscar for best documentary.) Snowden, meanwhile, ended up in Russia. He had embarked on a trip to Ecuador, but the United States revoked his passport midflight, leaving him stranded in Moscow. For Russia, Snowden was like a bird that flew in through an open window  ‚Äî   or, as Putin joked, an unwanted Christmas present. But politically speaking, he could be useful. After enduring the United States‚Äô endless lectures about human rights, the Kremlin could suddenly welcome a man who exposed   American hypocrisy. Kucherena entered the picture as Snowden‚Äôs lifeline, or at least as someone who could help him navigate Russia‚Äôs asylum laws. An experienced lawyer, Kucherena was appointed by Putin to the Public Council, overseeing the Federal Security Service (F. S. B. ). Snowden‚Äôs case presented a new opportunity. It took Kucherena a month to negotiate Snowden‚Äôs stay and three months to write ‚ÄúTime of the Octopus. ‚Äù Stone‚Äôs first meeting with Kucherena was a disaster. (‚ÄúI thought he was a gruff bear,‚Äù Stone told me.) The director wanted to meet Snowden, but Kucherena said Snowden wouldn‚Äôt meet them until they agreed to option ‚ÄúTime of the Octopus. ‚Äù (Kucherena denies this.) According to Stone and Borman, by the end of a long weekend, they reached a gentlemen‚Äôs agreement: Stone would option the novel  ‚Äî   if Kucherena could provide regular access to his client. I first spoke to Stone in June 2015, after reading that he was in the midst of shooting a film based on Kucherena‚Äôs novel. He said he would be traveling to Moscow again that week to shoot Snowden and agreed to let me tag along. A day later, a peeved Borman called me. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve been disinvited,‚Äù he said coolly. During those 24 hours, this magazine had contacted Ben Wizner, Snowden‚Äôs lawyer at the American Civil Liberties Union, to arrange an interview with his client. Kucherena may be Snowden‚Äôs Russian representative, but in the United States, Wizner runs the show. Wizner was furious. Not just because Stone had invited a reporter to Moscow, but because of how it all looked: that Snowden was involved in a Hollywood movie and that the whole production was seemingly brokered by a lawyer with ties to the Kremlin. Borman would later tell me that we had waded into the sticky territory of Snowden‚Äôs multiple emissaries. ‚ÄúThere are two ways to access him: One is Kucherena and one is Wizner, and it‚Äôs completely political,‚Äù Borman said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a political situation that goes way above your head. ‚Äù When Wizner and I finally got on the phone, he was in   control mode. He told me that Snowden wasn‚Äôt profiting from Stone‚Äôs film in any way. ‚ÄúOne    rule Ed always had was, I‚Äôm not selling my life rights,‚Äù Wizner said. Snowden‚Äôs participation in a Hollywood movie would only fuel the claims of his critics  ‚Äî   that he was a narcissist eager to cash in. That said, Stone‚Äôs film would be seen by millions of people, which meant it could sway public opinion. ‚ÄúWe were choosing between two bad options,‚Äù Wizner said. ‚ÄúHe could have stubbornly stayed completely at arm‚Äôs length and had no input whatsoever. Or he could have some input and compromised the arm‚Äô  relationship. And I didn‚Äôt know how to advise him on that. ‚Äù According to Wizner, Snowden met with Stone only to make sure that the film told an accurate story. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs been us walking this tightrope between clearly not having any formal connection to the project  ‚Äî   not deriving any benefit from it  ‚Äî   and also not wanting to just be completely helpless and, you know, see what Oliver Stone comes up with,‚Äù Wizner said. Despite some initial discomfort, he was tentatively optimistic. ‚ÄúMaybe it‚Äôll be good,‚Äù Wizner added. ‚ÄúYou know, Oliver Stone wrote ‚ÄòScarface. ‚Äô‚Äôu2009‚Äù Still, Stone was heading to Moscow to film Snowden for an appearance in the movie, which could be seen as an endorsement.   checking is one thing, I said a cameo is another. ‚ÄúIt is, and I‚Äôm not entirely comfortable with it,‚Äù Wizner said. Wizner had negotiated veto control over any footage featuring Snowden in the film. After we spoke, the lawyer says he asked Borman to put that in writing. He also reiterated that if Stone took a reporter along, Snowden would not participate. Stone and I eventually reached a compromise: I wouldn‚Äôt observe the shoot, but I could still come and meet Kucherena. A few days later, I met Stone in Moscow. The director, who is 69, has a   leaning gait and unruly eyebrows, so that he looks a bit like a bull that is always about to charge. He emerged from the hotel‚Äôs elevator with a pained look on his face. It was drizzling, and Stone‚Äôs hair, which is the color of dark shoe polish, was pointing laterally. ‚ÄúI have some bad news,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI cannot deliver Anatoly. ‚Äù He had just seen Snowden, who had been in touch with Wizner and was very upset, Stone said. ‚ÄúEd said he doesn‚Äôt want Anatoly talking to you, and he said that very clearly,‚Äù Stone added. I would spend the next few days camped out at the hotel. When Stone wasn‚Äôt shooting, we would meet in the lobby bar as he continued to tell me about the making of his film. Soon after optioning Kucherena‚Äôs novel, Stone had returned to Moscow with his   writer, Kieran Fitzgerald, a recent University of Texas M. F. A. graduate. Anticipating a homesick Snowden, Fitzgerald hauled over a duffel bag packed with the stuff of Americana dreams: Kraft macaroni and cheese,    cups, Oreos, Pepperidge Farm cookies, Twizzlers, peanut butter, Spam, an Orioles baseball cap and a pair of Converse sneakers. ‚ÄúIt was like delivering a care package to a kid at summer camp,‚Äù Fitzgerald told me. He also slipped in a copy of ‚ÄúThe Odyssey‚Äù translated by his grandfather, Robert Fitzgerald. ‚ÄúI thought it was appropriate, since Ed was on his own kind of odyssey trying to get home. ‚Äù Snowden and Stone had gotten off to a slow start. Snowden was squeamish about a movie being made about his life. Stone, in turn, said the film would be made with or without him. Fitzgerald says he played referee. ‚ÄúOliver can be a bit of battering ram,‚Äù Fitzgerald said. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs accustomed to hard men who need to be cracked, but that‚Äôs not Edward Snowden. He‚Äôs not an   male type. He‚Äôs a very sensitive mind. So I was there to say: ‚ÄòEverything is going to be O. K. He‚Äôs a good guy. It‚Äôs going to be a good movie. ‚Äô‚Äôu2009‚Äù Eventually, Snowden began to open up, answering questions about his childhood his girlfriend, Lindsay Mills and what he could about his work for the N. S. A. While Fitzgerald returned to Austin to work on the script, Stone set out to plant his flag in the Snowden story. In Hollywood, book options are the equivalent of calling dibs, and Stone had competition. In May 2014, Sony Pictures optioned Greenwald‚Äôs ‚ÄúNo Place to Hide. ‚Äù By June, Stone had announced that he acquired Kucherena‚Äôs book and Harding‚Äôs ‚ÄúThe Snowden Files. ‚Äù The tactic worked. Sony got nervous. ‚ÄúNow what?‚Äù Amy Pascal, then Sony‚Äôs   chairwoman, wrote to another executive. (The email would be leaked during the Sony hack.) Pascal‚Äôs colleague reminded her of the case of the dual Steve Jobs biopics  ‚Äî   ‚ÄúJobs,‚Äù with Ashton Kutcher, might have come out first, but it was ‚ÄúSteve Jobs,‚Äù starring Michael Fassbender, that was the better film. Pascal wasn‚Äôt convinced. ‚ÄúOliver Stone is not Ashton Kutcher,‚Äù she responded. She wrote to George Clooney to pique his interest in adapting Greenwald‚Äôs book, but Clooney passed. ‚ÄúStone will do a hatchet job on the movie, but it will still be the film of Snowden,‚Äù he replied. For Stone, the impending Sony project was a call to arms. Fitzgerald cranked out a first draft of the script, and that fall Stone went out to studios with a budget of $50 million and a release date in December 2015. Each one turned it down, and Stone became convinced that the studios wanted to quash the project because of its controversial subject matter. ‚ÄúThis is why corporations owning movie studios is not a good idea,‚Äù he said. While Borman hustled to find independent financing, Stone dove into casting. For the lead, he chose Joseph   Levitt, the son of liberals from Sherman Oaks, Calif. and a former child actor who has retained a pleasingly boyish look. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs an interesting blandness to him in the same way that Jimmy Stewart might‚Äôve been considered bland,‚Äù Stone said. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a neutrality there, which allows him to grow on you. ‚Äù Shailene Woodley was cast to play Lindsay Mills, Zachary Quinto as Greenwald and Melissa Leo as Poitras. By early 2015, Borman and Stone had racked up several hundred thousand dollars in debt, but the money was still short. The shoot was ultimately delayed three weeks as the producer cobbled together European partners. In the United States, ‚ÄúSnowden‚Äù was picked up by Open Road Films, a small production company that had just put out ‚ÄúJobs‚Äù  ‚Äî   the Kutcher version. ‚ÄúIt was painful that we ended up with this independent distributor,‚Äù Stone said. Borman offered that Open Road was not so independent anymore. ‚ÄúI‚Äôd never heard of it,‚Äù Stone said, adding: ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been there before, but not on this level and not at this age. So for me, it was very difficult personally. ‚Äù The cover of ‚ÄúTime of the Octopus‚Äù features a   image of Snowden‚Äôs face and a globe peeled like an orange to reveal the logo of the C. I. A. In his author photo, Kucherena indeed looks bearish, with a round face, matted white hair and a cellphone pressed to his right ear  ‚Äî   as if he were midnegotiation. ‚ÄúThe whole truth about the American agent on the run,‚Äù the cover boasts. Also: ‚ÄúOliver Stone is currently shooting a film based on this book. ‚Äù I had gotten my copy from Stone, who handed it to me with a disclaimer. ‚ÄúNow, it‚Äôs easy to take a shot at this,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúYou know, it wasn‚Äôt the basis of the movie. But it‚Äôs fun. I enjoyed reading it. ‚Äù ‚ÄúTime of the Octopus‚Äù takes place in a single night. The protagonist, Joshua Cold, is sequestered in a bunker at Sheremetyevo Airport, where his Russian lawyer keeps him company. The chapters alternate between their   stamped conversations and those labeled as digital files (‚ÄúFile 004. wav‚Äù) suggesting that they are the lawyer‚Äôs transcribed recordings. The basic facts of Cold‚Äôs case sound familiar, as do the character names: There are journalists named Boitras and Greywold and an organization called Mikileaks run by an Augusto Cassangie. For the most part, Cold and the lawyer sit and talk about life, quoting Laozi to each other. But there is also a distinctly   Soviet tone to the novel, which reads both like a love letter to American culture  ‚Äî   Steven Spielberg, B. B. King, ‚ÄúThe Terminator,‚Äù Penthouse magazine, Popeye, ‚ÄúThe  ‚Äù Paul Newman, Bon Jovi, ‚Äú  Man,‚Äù ‚ÄúBraveheart,‚Äù Quentin Tarantino and Tupac Shakur are all mentioned  ‚Äî   and a gleeful taunt to its government. ‚ÄúNot only did [Cold] snap the beak of the American eagle,‚Äù Kucherena writes, ‚Äúbut he also gave him a good kick and a very humiliating one, as if it was not a menacing predator but a rural hen. ‚Äù In the bunker, Cold enjoys pizza and whiskey, but he is worried about American agents coming to retrieve him. ‚ÄúBelieve me, Russia is not the worst option for you,‚Äù the lawyer tells Cold. ‚ÄúAnd you needn‚Äôt regard us with such mistrust. ‚Äù Once Cold is granted asylum, the propaganda is dialed up. ‚ÄúI shall work in Russia and get an apartment!‚Äù Cold announces. ‚ÄúI thought I would spend the rest of my life in this underground prison. ‚Äù ‚ÄúAs far as I know Mr. Putin, he is not one to change his mind easily,‚Äù the lawyer assures him. ‚ÄúAll will be O. K. ‚Äù The novel concludes with Cold vowing to learn to drink like the Russians, but the lawyer suggests he try Kvass instead, a fermented beverage made from rye bread. (‚ÄúIt is the Russian   Cola,‚Äù the lawyer says.) Then they leave the bunker. ‚ÄúWeird, huh?‚Äù Fitzgerald said when I asked about the novel. In fact, few people associated with either Snowden or ‚ÄúSnowden‚Äù wanted to discuss it. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to say anything on the record about that book,‚Äù   Levitt told me. According to WikiLeaks, Stone paid a million dollars for ‚ÄúTime of the Octopus,‚Äù which seemed like a hefty amount to pay for material that Stone admitted he had no plans of using. (That‚Äôs the same figure Sony reportedly paid for the rights to ‚ÄúEat, Pray, Love. ‚Äù) ‚ÄúWe bought it because we did get good access to Ed,‚Äù Stone explained. ‚ÄúHe had to be brought along. ‚Äù During Stone‚Äôs visits, Kucherena hosted the director at his favorite restaurants and at his dacha outside Moscow. ‚ÄúThey had a kind of bromance,‚Äù Fitzgerald told me. Photos from the trips look like vacation postcards, with Stone and Fitzgerald grinning in Red Army caps (a gift from Kucherena) and Fitzgerald and   Levitt posing for a selfie in front of St. Basil‚Äôs Cathedral. While out in public, the group referred to Snowden as ‚ÄúSasha,‚Äù a nickname Kucherena had given him. Kucherena and I would eventually speak by phone. He said he wrote the novel because he had received calls from many ‚Äúrepresentatives of Hollywood,‚Äù writers and filmmakers. ‚ÄúAt some point, I just thought to myself, Why don‚Äôt I try to write the book?‚Äù he said. I asked which writers and directors had called him. ‚ÄúVery many people called me,‚Äù he replied. ‚ÄúBut I honestly don‚Äôt remember their names now. ‚Äù The lawyer was deeply troubled by the news media‚Äôs insinuations that he is connected to the Kremlin. He pointed to several clients he has defended against the F. S. B. including Platon Obukhov, a writer accused of spying for Britain. ‚ÄúI never had any kind of agreement with the Kremlin,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThey tried to say I‚Äôm tied to the F. S. B. but that‚Äôs complete nonsense, excuse me. ‚Äù Kucherena said he was inspired by his favorite authors, who include Tom Clancy, Aldous Huxley and George Orwell. ‚ÄúThe Octopus in my novel is, you can say, a direct offspring of Big Brother,‚Äù he said. Like most writers of fiction, he was reluctant to discuss which parts of his book were based in reality. ‚ÄúA person can only be open with someone he trusts,‚Äù Kucherena said. ‚ÄúAnd here, because he had no one else, it turned out that I took on the role of mother and father. Accordingly, we had confidential conversations of various sorts. ‚Äù He did not see a conflict of interest in his writing the novel. ‚ÄúI wrote an artistic book,‚Äù Kucherena said. Because he represents Snowden pro bono, he never expected to capitalize on the relationship. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt take any money from him,‚Äù Kucherena said. ‚ÄúHe doesn‚Äôt have any. So I wrote a book, yes, fine. So I got a little, as we say in Russian. ‚Äù Despite being the one to put the ‚ÄúSnowden‚Äù project into motion, Kucherena shied away from assuming any credit. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm very far from all that,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm just an advocate. Look at where I am and where Hollywood is!‚Äù When I told Wizner that Stone said he bought Kucherena‚Äôs book to gain access to Snowden, his voice climbed a few octaves again. ‚ÄúVirtually every single other person who‚Äôs met with Snowden, and there have been dozens of them, have just gone through me, and we‚Äôve hooked it up,‚Äù Wizner said. He listed some names, which included the film director Doug Liman, as well as the actors Jared Leto and John Cusack. (Cusack took Snowden Cool Ranch Doritos, as well as DVDs of ‚ÄúNetwork‚Äù and ‚ÄúDr. Strangelove. ‚Äù) Wizner, who is 45, has been at the A. C. L. U. since 2001. Before Snowden, he tried to bring several suits to increase oversight over the intelligence community. Wizner likes to say that he spent a decade banging his head against a wall, and then Snowden came along and brought that wall down. Snowden had not only revealed the scope of the surveillance apparatus, but also that top government officials routinely misled the public about it. Since becoming Snowden‚Äôs advocate, Wizner has become a figure of not insignificant geopolitical importance. Those revelations have since formed a critical backdrop for legislative reforms, and there are few things that irritate Wizner more than claims that threaten to tarnish Snowden‚Äôs character and their common cause. It would not be a stretch to say that for Wizner, Kucherena has become a bit of a liability. Since 2013, the Russian lawyer has announced that Snowden landed a job at a major Russian website  ‚Äî   news that turned out to not be true  ‚Äî   and has supplied the news media with photos of his client enjoying his new life in Russia, attending an opera at the Bolshoi Theater and cheerfully hugging a dog named Rick. (Rick later turned out to be the dog of one of Kucherena‚Äôs friends.) Now Kucherena had sold a novel to Stone, making it seem as if the director had to pay a Russian fixer to have access to Snowden  ‚Äî   or worse, that Snowden was somehow under the lock and key of the Russian authorities, lent to Stone for a Hollywood movie. Wizner‚Äôs counterefforts in the United States have been successful. Former Attorney General Eric Holder, once a fierce critic, has acknowledged that Snowden performed ‚Äúa public service. ‚Äù President Obama has called for the reform of phone metadata collection, and last June, Congress passed the U. S. A. Freedom Act, a law that directly resulted from Snowden‚Äôs leaks. Snowden has come to be seen as a levelheaded activist. According to Wizner, he leads a free existence in Russia, making appearances via live video and publishing   against Russia‚Äôs human rights violations. ‚ÄúI think people are inclined to believe that Russia would never let him stay there unless he was paying for it in some way,‚Äù Wizner said. ‚ÄúBut it‚Äôs just not true. Not only is he not cooperating, but he‚Äôs actually being critical. ‚Äù When I asked Wizner about Kucherena‚Äôs book, we were meeting at a cafe near his office in Lower Manhattan. ‚ÄúMaybe you should just characterize my facial expression  ‚Äî   ‚ÄòHe smirked,‚Äô‚Äôu2009‚Äù Wizner said. (Except that his smirk was mixed with a frown.) According to him, Snowden has not read Kucherena‚Äôs book. ‚ÄúThe thing is, Ed has much bigger fish to fry,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIf you had people calling for your assassination, you‚Äôd be annoyed. If you were facing life in solitary confinement, you‚Äôd be concerned. If someone wrote some book in Russia that no one is going to read, it doesn‚Äôt register. ‚Äù Wizner was reluctant to discuss Kucherena‚Äôs role in Snowden‚Äôs life, but he conceded that it was somewhat unorthodox. ‚ÄúIt seems like the ethical rules governing the   client relationship may be somewhat different in Russia,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIt would be very unusual for a lawyer in a   profile case to provide exclusive photos of his client to newspapers or write an unauthorized book and sell it to Hollywood. ‚Äù Kucherena and Wizner have never met. Whatever uneasiness there may be, Kucherena spoke warmly about his American counterpart. ‚ÄúWe are on the same team!‚Äù he told me. ‚ÄúBen works in America, I work in Russia. If he wanted to write a book, I would have no problem. ‚Äù Wizner told me he has no plans to write a book about Snowden, fictional or otherwise. ‚ÄúMission accomplished,‚Äù Stone announced. We had met in the lobby bar again, the day after he filmed Snowden, and the director was in better spirits. The shoot took place at Kucherena‚Äôs dacha. The day went long. Stone‚Äôs idea was to interview Snowden and capture an affecting moment that would give the film its dramatic ending. But the first takes were stiff. ‚ÄúEd is used to answering questions on a level of intelligence,‚Äù Stone said. ‚ÄúBut I was interested in the emotional, which is difficult for him. ‚Äù Stone ended up doing nine takes. At one point, they took a break and went for a walk around Kucherena‚Äôs property. By the end of the day, Stone decided that he had gotten Snowden to go as far as he was going to. ‚ÄúHe was cooperative,‚Äù Stone said. ‚ÄúHe wanted to make it work. But as an actor  ‚Äî   he‚Äôs not used to that. I mean, he‚Äôs not an actor. And I don‚Äôt think he became one that day. ‚Äù To make Snowden more comfortable, Stone worked with a minimal crew. Some were meeting the   blower for the first time and still seemed a bit  . ‚ÄúSuddenly this little creature comes teetering in  ‚Äî   so fragile, so lovely, such a charming,   behaved, beautiful little man,‚Äù the cinematographer, Anthony Dod Mantle, told me. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs like an old soul in a very young body. He‚Äôs got fingers like violins. ‚Äù Filming Snowden reminded Mantle of shooting other men with outsize reputations and slight builds. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs like Bono or Al Pacino,‚Äù he added. ‚ÄúThose guys are   weenies. But if you isolate him into a frame, he can be as big as anybody else. ‚Äù Mantle shot Danny Boyle‚Äôs ‚ÄúSlumdog Millionaire‚Äù and ‚Äú127 Hours,‚Äù but ‚ÄúSnowden‚Äù proved to be a special challenge. Convinced that making the film on American soil would be too risky, Stone decided to film in Germany, where Borman was able to score some tax subsidies. With roughly 140 script pages to shoot in 54 days, the crew sprinted from Munich to Washington, to Hawaii, to Hong Kong, and then back to Munich. Often, Mantle wouldn‚Äôt get to see locations before he had to film in them. To cut costs, the suburbs of Munich had to stand in for rural Maryland and Virginia, with German extras cast as Americans. ‚ÄúThank God the Germans act like Americans,‚Äù Stone said. The production itself resembled a covert operation, with a code name (‚ÄúSasha‚Äù had stuck) and elaborate security protocols. Worried that ‚ÄúSasha‚Äù would be of interest to the N. S. A. Borman and Stone avoided discussing production details by phone or email  ‚Äî   ‚ÄúIt was all handwritten notes and long walks in the park,‚Äù Borman said  ‚Äî   and kept the script on   gapped computers, ones that have never been connected to the internet. If it had to be mailed, Borman would mix up the pages into four packages, which he would send with four different couriers to four different addresses. ‚ÄúMaybe nobody gave a [expletive],‚Äù Borman told me. ‚ÄúOr maybe the N. S. A. is laughing at us like, ‚ÄòLook at those idiots  ‚Äî   of course we copied everything that came through DHL and FedEx!‚Äù For the actors, the frenetic schedule and paranoia on set added to the mood of the production. ‚ÄúSnowden himself was in the midst of a stressful situation, so the fact that our shoot was a little bit that way, I think, helped,‚Äù   Levitt said, before catching himself. ‚ÄúMaking the movie was obviously a walk in the park compared to what he did. But just to have those little emotional touch points can help when you‚Äôre acting. ‚Äù Committed to inhabiting Snowden‚Äôs robotic speech pattern,   Levitt lifted the audio from ‚ÄúCitizenfour‚Äù and played it on repeat while he slept. He also worried that some of the dialogue felt   handed. ‚ÄúOliver is very into making his point,‚Äù the actor said, ‚Äúas he should be. I really admire him for that. But I felt like it was my job to be like, ‚ÄòO. K. I want to make the point, too, but this is a human being and not just a mouthpiece. ‚Äù Stone found   Levitt‚Äôs approach too ‚Äú  ish‚Äù at times. ‚ÄúI was trying for the dramatic side as much as possible,‚Äù Stone said. Fitzgerald was ultimately flown in to the set to execute   minute rewrites. By late spring of 2015, Stone was close to wrapping when his mother, Jacqueline Goddet Stone, died at 93. She had called him in Munich, but Stone felt he couldn‚Äôt risk leaving. ‚ÄúTo go to L. A. would have cost us three down days,‚Äù Stone told me. ‚ÄúI knew she was going to pass, but I thought I could make it. ‚Äù Stone remained on set during the funeral and kept shooting. Stone‚Äôs trip to Moscow to film the real Snowden was the last bit he needed to complete the film. But he was still worried  ‚Äî   that the footage would be leaked, that critics would eviscerate it, that Snowden wouldn‚Äôt like it. ‚ÄúI want him to vet it,‚Äù he said. He was heading to New York to begin editing and planned to return to Moscow at the end of the summer to show Snowden a rough cut. ‚ÄúO. K. my dear,‚Äù Stone said, getting up to leave. ‚ÄúSee you in New York. ‚Äù Then he disappeared for six months. Before Stone set out to make his film, he had met Snowden‚Äôs chief biographers, Greenwald and Poitras. Stone and Greenwald became friendly, and when Greenwald‚Äôs book drew interest in Hollywood before it was published, the journalist turned to Stone for advice. ‚ÄúIn the back of my mind, I thought if he had any interest in making a film, that would be a good segue for him to say so,‚Äù Greenwald told me. At the time, Stone wasn‚Äôt interested, and Greenwald negotiated the deal with Sony. Stone later came back and offered to match Sony‚Äôs bid, but Greenwald declined. ‚ÄúI think he was a little perturbed,‚Äù Greenwald said. Of the principal cast, Zachary Quinto, who plays Greenwald in Stone‚Äôs movie, was the only actor who didn‚Äôt meet his   counterpart as research. ‚ÄúI always thought that was a little weird,‚Äù Greenwald said. ‚ÄúI think Oliver thought I had some competitive hostility toward his project, or he had some hostility  ‚Äî   I‚Äôm not really sure. ‚Äù (According to Stone, Quinto didn‚Äôt need to meet Greenwald because there were so many videos of the journalist online.) In the spring of 2014, Stone flew to Berlin and met with Poitras. The meeting did not go well. According to Poitras, Stone proposed that she delay the release of ‚ÄúCitizenfour,‚Äù which she was then in the middle of editing, to time up with his fi",,

Republican nominee Donald Trump has been strategically placing certain people behind his him at rallies to create a false illusion about the diversity of his supporters. You may have noticed a man holding a ‚ÄúBLACKS FOR TRUMP‚Äù sign behind the racist rabble-rouser at his events, with a website URL ‚ÄúGODS2.com‚Äù underneath it. If you‚Äôve wondered just what kind of black Americans could bring themselves to support Trump or if this election could get any weirder, well, hold on to your seat. 
The man holding the sign is ‚ÄúMichael the Black Man,‚Äù also known as Maurice Woodside or Michael Symonette. LittleGreenFootballs did some research and discovered that Michael isn‚Äôt your ordinary concerned citizen. He‚Äôs a former member of a murderous cult , Yahweh ben Yahweh, led by preacher Hulon Mitchell Jr. 
Michael, along with 15 other Yahweh followers, was charged for allegedly conspiring in two murders; his brother, who was also in the cult, told jurors that Michael had helped beat one man who was later killed and stuck a sharpened stick into another man‚Äôs eyeball. But jurors found Michael (and six other Yahweh followers) innocent. They sent Mitchell away for 20 years in the federal pen. 
Michael later reinvented himself as a radio host and an anti-gay, anti-Obama preacher and soon found himself in the spotlight at Republican events, whose organizers were delighted to have found another person of color to attack Obama without being obviously racist. His website, GODS2.com, is filled with the delusional, vaguely anti-Semitic rantings of a madman and homages to Yahweh. 
This may not mean much in the long run, but it‚Äôs worth pointing out just how outrageous the hypocrisy of the Trump campaign is. Trump attacked Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton when the father of the Orlando nightclub shooter appeared in the stands behind her at a rally out of chance, accusing her of associating with the father of a deranged murderer ‚Äì but this man is actually being planted behind Trump because of his skin color.

Hillary Clinton has taken her illegal actions to a new level with a new move that involves enlisting the help of illegal immigrants to help her beat Donald Trump in November. 
Once again, Hillary is in violation of 8 U.S. Code ¬ß 1324, which makes it a felony to ‚Äòconceal‚Äô or ‚Äòharbor‚Äô any ‚Äòalien‚Äô ‚Äòincluding any means of transportation.‚Äô The penalty is five years in prison (ten years if it was done for ‚Äúcommercial advantage or private financial gain,‚Äù could be made for that). Hillary and the DNC also violated this law a few weeks back at the Democratic National Convention when they paraded two illegal immigrants across the stage to give an anti- Trump speech. 
Hillary Clinton is enlisting undocumented ‚ÄúDreamers‚Äù into a new voter registration drive aimed at signing up sympathetic voters with warnings that Donald Trump ‚Äôs immigration plans could result in their deportation ‚Äì though the Dreamers themselves cannot legally vote. 
Clinton‚Äôs national voter registration program, called ‚ÄúMi Sue√±o, Tu Voto/My Dream, Your Vote,‚Äù was announced Sunday, on the four-year anniversary of the 2012 order that temporarily shielded from deportation some young immigrants brought to the country illegally as children. 
The 730,000 young people known as Dreamers are prohibited from voting. However, they remain a powerful political organizing force, and the Clinton campaign hopes to use them to convince Latino and other households to go to the polls for the Democratic nominee.

"Russia, Cina e Arabia Saudita domano l‚Äôegemonia del dollaro di Ariel Noyola Rodr√≠guez 
Gli Stati Uniti aumentano gli ostacoli tentando di mantenere l‚Äôegemonia del dollaro come valuta di riserva mondiale. Negli ultimi mesi, i Paesi emergenti hanno venduto un molti buoni del tesoro degli USA, principalmente Russia e Cina, ma anche Arabia Saudita. Inoltre, per proteggersi dalle violente fluttuazioni del dollaro, le banche centrali di diversi Paesi acquistano enormi quantit√† di oro per diversificare le riserve valutarie. In breve, l‚Äôoffensiva globale nei confronti del dollaro √® esplosa attraverso la vendita massiccia di debito degli Stati Uniti e, in parallelo, l‚Äôacquisto colossale di metalli preziosi. Rete Voltaire | Citt√† del Messico (Messico) | 5 novembre 2016 fran√ßais Espa√±ol 
La supremazia di Washington nel sistema finanziario globale ha subito un colpo tremendo ad agosto: Russia, Cina e Arabia Saudita vendevamo titoli del Tesoro degli Stati Uniti per 37,9 miliardi di dollari, secondo l‚Äôultimo aggiornamento dei dati ufficiali pubblicato da pochi giorni [ 1 ]. Dal punto di vista generale, gli investimenti globali nel debito pubblico degli Stati Uniti sono al livello minimo dal luglio 2012. Chiaramente, il ruolo del dollaro a valuta di riserva mondiale √® ancora messo in discussione. 
Nel 2010, l‚Äôammiraglio Michael Mullen, presidente del Joint Chiefs of Staff statunitense, avvert√¨ che il debito era la principale minaccia alla sicurezza nazionale [ 2 ]. A mio avviso, non √® tanto l‚Äôalto debito pubblico (oltre i 19 000 miliardi [ 3 ]) ad ostacolare l‚Äôeconomia degli Stati Uniti, ma per Washington √® di fondamentale importanza garantirsi un enorme flusso di risorse estere ogni giorno, per coprire i deficit gemelli (commercio e bilancio); cio√® per il dipartimento del Tesoro √® questione di vita o di morte vendere titoli di debito nel mondo e cos√¨ finanziare le spese degli USA. 
Si ricordi che dal fallimento di Lehman Brothers nel settembre 2008, Bank of China ha subito forti pressioni da Ben Bernanke, allora presidente della Federal Reserve (FED), a non vendere i titoli del debito degli Stati Uniti. In un primo momento, i cinesi decisero di mantenere il dollaro. Tuttavia, da allora, per due volte, la PBoC evitava di acquistare altri titoli degli Stati Uniti e, allo stesso tempo, avviava un piano per diversificare le riserve valutarie. 
Pechino acquista oro in maniera massiccia negli ultimi anni, e lo stesso fa la banca centrale della Russia. Nel secondo trimestre del 2016, le riserve auree della Banca di Cina hanno raggiunto le 1 823 tonnellate contro le 1 762 tonnellate registrate nell‚Äôultimo trimestre del 2015. La Federazione Russa ha aumentato le riserve auree di circa 290 tonnellate tra dicembre 2014 e giugno 2016, chiudendo il secondo trimestre di quest‚Äôanno con un totale di 1 500 tonnellate. 
Di fronte ai brutali scossoni del dollaro √® fondamentale acquistare asset pi√π sicuri come l‚Äôoro che, in tempi di grave instabilit√† finanziaria, agisce da rifugio sicuro. Quindi la strategia di Mosca e Pechino nel vendere titoli del Tesoro degli USA e comprare oro, viene seguita da molti Paesi. Come stimato dal Fondo monetario internazionale (FMI), le riserve auree delle banche centrali nel mondo hanno gi√† raggiunto il massimo degli ultimi 15 anni, registrando ai primi di ottobre un volume di circa 33 000 tonnellate [ 4 ]. 
La geopolitica fa la sua parte nel plasmare il nuovo ordine finanziario mondiale. Dopo l‚Äôimposizione delle sanzioni economiche al Cremlino, a partire dal 2014, il rapporto con la Cina ha avuto grande rilevanza per i russi. Da allora, le due potenze hanno approfondito i legami in tutti i settori, dall‚Äôeconomia e finanza alla cooperazione militare. Inoltre, assicurando la fornitura di gas alla Cina per i prossimi tre decenni, il Presidente Vladimir Putin ha costruito con l‚Äôomologo Xi Jinping una potente alleanza finanziaria che cerca di porre fine una volta per tutte al dominio della moneta statunitense. 
Attualmente, gli idrocarburi che Mosca vende a Pechino sono pagati in yuan, non dollari. Cos√¨, la ‚Äúmoneta del popolo‚Äù (‚Äòrenminbi‚Äô in cinese) emerge gradualmente nel mercato mondiale degli idrocarburi con il commercio tra Russia e Cina, Paesi che, a mio parere, guidano la costruzione del sistema monetario multipolare. 
La grande novit√† √® che alla corsa per la dedollarizzazione dell‚Äôeconomia globale si √® unita l‚ÄôArabia Saudita, Paese per decenni fedele alleato della politica estera di Washington. Sorprendentemente, negli ultimi 12 mesi Riad s‚Äô√® sbarazzata di pi√π di 19 miliardi di dollari investiti in titoli del Tesoro degli Stati Uniti, divenendo insieme alla Cina uno dei principali venditori di debito degli Stati Uniti [ 5 ]. A peggiorare le cose, il regno saudita si accanisce sempre pi√π con la Casa Bianca. 
A fine settembre, il Congresso degli Stati Uniti approvava l‚Äôeliminazione del veto del presidente Barack Obama ad una legge che impediva negli USA di denunciare l‚ÄôArabia Saudita in tribunale per il presunto coinvolgimento negli attentati dell‚Äô11 settembre 2001 [ 6 ]. Insieme, l‚ÄôOrganizzazione dei Paesi Esportatori del Petrolio (OPEC) ha raggiunto un accordo storico con la Russia per ridurre la produzione di petrolio e quindi promuovere l‚Äôaumento dei prezzi [ 7 ]. 
E‚Äô anche sorprendente che giusto oggi Pechino abbia aperto allo scambio diretto tra yuan e riyal saudita attraverso il Trading System Foreign Exchange della Cina (CFETS, nell‚Äôacronimo inglese) per le transazioni tra le due valute senza passare dal dollaro. Di conseguenza, √® molto probabile che, pi√π prima che poi, la compagnia petrolifera Saudi Aramco accetti pagamenti in yuan invece che dollari [ 8 ]. Se si accadesse, la Casa dei Saud punterebbe tutto sul petroyuan [ 9 ]. Il mondo cambia davanti ai nostri occhi‚Ä¶",Foregin,
"NEW DELHI  ‚Äî   First, Yashpal Singh Rathore‚Äôs marriage was delayed by his future   who, like most Indians, ran short of cash after Prime Minister Narendra Modi banned the country‚Äôs largest currency notes in November. Then the    lost his job when the ensuing cash crunch hit demand for motorcycles and scooters sold by the company where he worked, Hero MotoCorp Ltd. After that, the prospective   refused to let the wedding go forward until he found another job. ‚ÄúSo I lost my job and I lost my marriage,‚Äù he said in an interview at a protest, where he shouted slogans with more than 100    workers let go by Hero. Mr. Rathore is one among a large number of Indians  ‚Äî   the precise number is not known  ‚Äî   who have lost their jobs since Nov. 8, when Mr. Modi abruptly banned 86 percent of the country‚Äôs currency in a bid to eliminate ‚Äúblack money,‚Äù currency on which taxes had not been paid. For the sake of secrecy, the government largely avoided printing replacement notes in advance. So there has been an acute and protracted shortage of cash as the government struggles to catch up. That, in turn, has proved economically damaging. Exactly how harmful remains hard to determine, but the available data is not reassuring. Demand for vegetables is declining because people don‚Äôt have the money to pay for them, for example, and some service industries are reporting steep job losses. The International Monetary Fund this month cut its projected growth rate for India by one percentage point for the current fiscal year, to 6. 6 percent. While the full impact is still difficult to discern, there is little doubt who is suffering the most. ‚ÄúThis has actually hurt the poor enormously,‚Äù said Nasser Munjee, chairman of DCB Bank and a company director at HDFC and Tata Motors. The pain is hidden, for the most part. Accustomed to hardship, many who lost employment were at first convinced by Mr. Modi‚Äôs speeches that their setbacks were transitory and, in the long run, would be worth the suffering. But as the crisis drags on, with no end in sight, some are growing frustrated, as they told us in a series of interviews at protests and at day labor gathering points. Many of them, even children, are forced to go without fruit, vegetables and milk  ‚Äî   now unaffordable luxuries. Most had not paid apartment rents and their children‚Äôs school fees in the months since the cash ban. Many had sent their families back to their villages, and were ready to give up and follow if things did not turn around soon. Sending cash to the elderly parents they had long supported is now out of the question. As is common in India, the workers said that although they had worked on Hero MotoCorp‚Äôs shop floor, wearing company uniforms, they had been formally employed by other contractors, meaning they could be let go more easily without benefits. Sunil Kumar, 28, who had been earning 15, 000 rupees a month, about $220, at Hero, said he had been supporting his wife and two children when he lost his job without notice Nov. 29. They immediately cut milk, green vegetables and fruit from their diets, including for their    and    children. Paying rent is out of the question. ‚ÄúThis is like a massacre for us,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúMy livelihood is gone after the cash ban. What do I do now?‚Äù The decline in vegetable demand is so steep that the prices of eggplants, potatoes, cauliflower and tomatoes dropped between 42 percent and 78 percent, the NCDEX Institute of Commodity Markets and Research said. In the first month alone after the currency ban, micro and   service industries cut staff by 35 percent, the All India Manufacturers‚Äô Organization said, based on a survey. It released a study this month saying that job losses in a variety of industries, including automobile parts, infrastructure and construction, would swell to as much as 35 percent by March. The anecdotal evidence is painful. Mr. Rathore, whose wedding was postponed, is among 582 workers who reported losing their jobs at Hero MotoCorp in November and December, as the company suffered a 34 percent drop in   sales in December from a year earlier. Hero did not respond to requests for comment. Most economists believe the economy will rebound, but nobody knows how long it will take. In Noida, a satellite city of New Delhi, hundreds of unshaven men in rumpled clothing stood recently at a   intersection called Khoda Labor Chowk that is a gathering place for people seeking work. Before the currency ban, they told us, they would be hired most days, earning 400 to 600 rupees, about $6 to $9, for a day of carpentry, floor tiling or masonry. But since the ban, most interviewed said, they had worked for only a week each month, at best, and even on the few days when they were hired their wages had fallen by half. Rafiq Ali, 46, said that, having worked only 12 days in the last two months, he had sent his wife and two children back to his native village about 200 miles away, where it is cheaper to live. ‚ÄúI am surviving on roti and potato with salt,‚Äù Mr. Ali said, referring to the flat Indian bread that is a staple in the Indian diet. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve stopped taking milk, even in tea, and eating vegetables. ‚Äù But what hurt him most, he said, was a recent call from his wife, back in the village, who wanted money to take their sick daughter to a doctor. Mr. Ali said he had nothing to send. ‚ÄúA sense of desperation and helplessness is emerging,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThis currency ban is not helpful for poor people. ‚Äù Hoti Lal, a    father of three, said he could get work for only six days during the last two months, forcing his family to survive on money his    son made cleaning offices. Mr. Lal had hoped his son could give up that job to go to college, but that dream is fading fast. His son‚Äôs salary of 7, 000 rupees a month, a little over $100, is about half of what he used to earn regularly, Mr. Lal said. So, Mr. Lal said, his family has cut back entirely on green vegetables and milk. Almost every man we interviewed said he was a migrant who had been sending a portion of his salary home to support his parents in his native village  ‚Äî   and had been unable to do so since the currency ban wiped out work. Vikas Sahu, 30, who had been working at Hero for four years, has been unable to send money back to his parents, wife and children, who live in his village about 100 miles west of New Delhi. His first grader‚Äôs school fees are overdue by months, and his father took out a loan of 70, 000 rupees, about $1, 000, for agricultural expenses, including paying for repairs on the family‚Äôs tractor. ‚ÄúHow long I can survive like this?‚Äù he asked. With little else to do, Rakesh Yadav, 28, shows up most days to protest, hoping for some relief from the government or some upbeat economic news that might induce Hero to begin rehiring. He had worked there for eight years as a machine operator on the shop floor. To cut costs, his wife and daughter went home to his village. He gave up the one room they had shared at a monthly rental of 3, 300 rupees, or about $50, and moved in with four other men who share a room. ‚ÄúI do not know where to go or what to do,‚Äù he said. Mr. Rathore said he thought about giving up and returning to his village in Bilaspur district, about 750 miles south of Delhi, but he just cannot bear to do so, at least not yet. ‚ÄúWhat can I do in my village?‚Äù he asked.",Foregin,
"While support for the Trump administration‚Äôs positions on many issues has declined in recent months, one of the president‚Äôs most controversial policies has held its ground or perhaps even grown in popularity. [Some of the administration‚Äôs most popular positions have seen their popularity decline, according to CNBC‚Äôs quarterly ‚ÄúAll American Survey. ‚Äù The share of Americans who say they somewhat or strongly support the administration‚Äôs plans to rebuild American infrastructure, for example, has declined to 62 percent from 75 percent three months earlier. Support for individual tax cuts has fallen to 59 percent from 64 percent, while support for cuts to business taxes fell to 50 percent from 54 percent.  Renegotiating trade deals has lost support, falling to 50 percent from 58 percent. Support for regulatory relief has declined to 44 percent from 47 percent. Public support for repealing Obamacare very nearly held steady, losing just one percentage point of support from 45 percent to 44 percent. But the public remains strongly divided on healthcare, with opposition to the administration‚Äôs repeal and replace plans edging up to 38 percent from 37 percent in April. So which issue has gained popularity? Banning immigration from specific Middle Eastern and African countries. Public support for the ban rose by a percentage point, with 44 percent of Americans now saying the strongly or somewhat support the ban. That slight rise was due to a one percentage point gain in the ‚Äústrongly support‚Äù category. Opposition to the ban has slightly declined, falling to 49 percent from 50 percent. The share of respondents who said they ‚Äústrongly oppose‚Äù the plan, however, saw a steeper decline, to 32 percent from 36 percent.    ",Foregin,

Speaking at a Hillary Clinton fundraiser in Canton, Ohio, last November, former President Bill Clinton (right) expressed disappointment concerning a then-recent Democratic presidential candidates‚Äô debate, during which, he said, there was not a single mention of the fact that ‚Äú84 percent of the American people, after inflation, had not had a raise of 1 cent since the financial crash.‚Äù 
The financial crash of which Clinton spoke began in late 2007 and extended into 2008 ‚Äî the year Barack Obama was elected president. Though his administration was not responsible for the crash, when Clinton spoke last year, Obama had been president for more than six years. Therefore, Clinton‚Äôs observations indicated that the vast majority of Americans had made no financial progress during Obama‚Äôs entire first term and half of his second term. 
Britain‚Äôs Daily Mail reported that the former president‚Äôs speech was published by WikiLeaks as part of the website‚Äôs release of Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta‚Äôs e-mails. 
In addition to the lack of income growth among most Americans, Clinton revealed a remarkable statistic: The life expectancy of middle-aged, non-college-educated white Americans is declining. Said the former president: And in the middle of all this we learned, breathtakingly, that middle-aged, non-college-educated white Americans‚Äô life expectancy is going down and is now lower than Hispanics, even though they make less money. And the gap between African Americans and whites is closing, but unfortunately not because the death rate among African Americans is dropping but because the death rate among white Americans is rising. Why? Because they don‚Äôt have anything to look forward to when they get up in the morning. Because their lives are sort of stuck in neutral. 
Clinton‚Äôs explanation that the reason that middle-aged, non-college-educated white Americans‚Äô life expectancy is going down is because ‚Äúthey don‚Äôt have anything to look forward to when they get up in the morning‚Äù is probably an oversimplification that requires greater analysis. 
The obvious reason why someone may not have anything to look forward to when they get up in the morning is because they are unemployed and therefore have no job to go to. Figures released by the Bureau of Labor Statistics for 2015 ‚Äî the year Clinton gave his speech ‚Äî indicated that those with only a high-school diploma had a 5.4 percent unemployment rate, compared with a 2.8 percent rate for those with bachelor‚Äôs degrees. (These figures did not account for race, and they didn't count literally millions of unemployed Americans: After a few months of looking for work, the government drops them from the unemployment rolls, deeming them to not want to work. In 2009, 80 million Americans were deemed not in the labor force; now it's 95 million. Also, if an American is able to find a low-paying part-time job out of his field, he is considered employed by the government.) 
An article published by Fortune on November 3, 2015 (about two weeks before Clinton‚Äôs speech) may have provided him with a basis for his statement. The article‚Äôs headline? ‚ÄúIs the Economy Killing Middle-Aged White People?‚Äù The article cited a survey released by a pair of researchers at Princeton University the previous day showing ‚Äúa striking increase in the death rates of white, middle-aged Americans who have less than a college education.‚Äù 
Though the researchers Angus Deaton, the 2015 Nobel laureate in Economics, and his wife, Anne Case, both professors at Princeton, didn‚Äôt form any steadfast conclusions about the reasons for the increase in death rates, they did speculate that economic factors are likely at least partly responsible. Fortune reported: Between 1999 and 2013, white men and women ages 45-54 saw their mortality rate increase by a half-percent per year, reversing decades of improvements up until that time. The main causes were suicide and the use of alcohol and drugs (both legal and illegal), according to the study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. 
The article noted that while it is impossible to know for sure how attributable the high death rates are to economic forces without more study, the Princeton researchers have speculated that the economic crisis of 2008 might have been a major factor. 
The research paper considered an explanation for why the higher death rate has affected white middle-aged people more than those in other ethnic and racial groups subject to the same economic downturn. Their explanation was that ‚Äúworking-class whites have decades of relative success and security behind them‚Ä¶. For the first time, perhaps, that group has seen a reversal of its fortunes.‚Äù 
We might add another explanation for the increased mortality rates: Workers accustomed to having their medical care paid for by their employers may find that, upon becoming unemployed, they can no longer afford medical insurance and, as a result, neglect the healthcare necessary to maintain their health. 
While Clinton did not refer to the Princeton professors' paper in his speech, it is possible that its release just weeks before did provide him with some talking points. 
Clinton‚Äôs comments were made in the context of a stump speech on behalf of his wife‚Äôs candidacy, and he did not offer any substantive solutions for the crisis among white middle-aged Americans. He instead offered this vague proposal: We have unlimited potential in America to grow our economy if we do a few things right, and not a lot. Five or six or seven things, really we‚Äôll see jobs start forming again; we‚Äôll see business formation going up again; we‚Äôll see wages rising again. And I believe she‚Äôs outlined reasonable responses to all the things that will do that. And I ought to have some credibility on that, because the only time in 50 years when all sections of the American economy have grown together were in the eight years I had the privilege to serve. 
In that regard, Clinton (on behalf of his wife) shared in rival candidate Donald Trump‚Äôs tendency to make many promises to grow the economy and create jobs offering higher wages, while offering few concrete details about how these lofty goals might be realized. Considering that the best thing that government can do to stimulate the economy is simply to get out of the way and allow the free market to flourish, however, any plan offered by a former Cabinet member of the administration that gave us ObamaCare might well be viewed with skepticism. We might also want to remember that the former president is the one who signed NAFTA, the trade deal that negatively impacted American jobs ‚Äî leaving many Americans without ""anything to look forward to when they get up in the morning.‚Äù",Foregin,
"Comments 
Former US Attorney General Eric Holder just wrote an op-ed warning the American people to disregard the FBI Director James Comey‚Äôs unprecedented decision to release information about an ongoing investigation during the heat of an election. Comey released a vague memo when he had little more to go on other than a mere suspicion and is now facing bipartisan calls for removal from office. Democratic congressional staffers now claim that their first warning of the Comey memo was when a House Republican tweeted it out with the usual anti-Hillary spin. That alone demonstrates exactly what Holder wrote about preventing ‚Äúinvestigations from unfairly or unintentionally casting public suspicion,‚Äù which happened nearly instantly on Friday afternoon. 
Former Attorney General Holder also pointed out that Comey‚Äôs ‚Äúnewly discovered‚Äù emails have no known significance and that the FBI Director violated long standing policies in the Department of Justice ‚Äì which are non-partisan ‚Äì aimed at upholding the integrity of America‚Äôs form of electoral democracy, free from government intervention: 
I understand the gravity of the work our Justice Department performs every day to defend the security of our nation, protect the American people, uphold the rule of law and be fair. That is why I am deeply concerned about FBI Director James B. Comey‚Äôs decision to write a vague letter to Congress about emails potentially connected to a matter of public, and political, interest. That decision was incorrect. 
The department also has a policy of not taking unnecessary action close in time to Election Day that might influence an election‚Äôs outcome. These rules have been followed during Republican and Democratic administrations. They aren‚Äôt designed to help any particular individual or to serve any political interest. Instead, they are intended to ensure that every investigation proceeds fairly and judiciously; to maintain the public trust in the department‚Äôs ability to do its job free of political influence; and to prevent investigations from unfairly or unintentionally casting public suspicion on public officials who have done nothing wrong. 
Director Comey broke with these fundamental principles. I fear he has unintentionally and negatively affected public trust in both the Justice Department and the FBI. And he has allowed ‚Äî again without improper motive ‚Äî misinformation to be spread by partisans with less pure intentions. Already, we have learned that the importance of the discovery itself may have been overblown. According to the director himself, there is no indication yet that the ‚Äúnewly discovered‚Äù emails bear any significance at all. And yet, because of his decision to comment on this development before sufficient facts were known, the public has faced a torrent of conspiracy theories and misrepresentations. 
High ranking former Justice Department officials like Eric Holder do not make a career out of slamming their former colleagues, so it‚Äôs a very rare break in the ranks to see a former Attorney General publicly slam his former subordinate. The Hatch Act prevents federal officials from interfering in partisan elections and strictly demands that public officials refrain from doing anything that could impact an election. Holder wrote : 
I served with Jim Comey and I know him well. This is a very difficult piece for me to write. He is a man of integrity and honor. I respect him. But good men make mistakes. In this instance, he has committed a serious error with potentially severe implications. It is incumbent upon him ‚Äî or the leadership of the department ‚Äî to dispel the uncertainty he has created before Election Day. It is up to the director to correct his mistake ‚Äî not for the sake of a political candidate or campaign but in order to protect our system of justice and best serve the American people. 
FBI Director James Comey knew better than to release a vague memo about an ongoing investigation, which, even under normal circumstances, should never be done. That is why former Attorney General Holder felt compelled to rebuke him in this scathing op-ed. 
Hopefully, the current members of the Justice Department tasked with reviewing the bipartisan complaints read the memo and expedite their decision concerning the future of the FBI Director. 
It should not take long for any rational investigator to determine that James Comey‚Äôs ‚Äúcry wolf‚Äù memo was little more than a partisan prop handed to a failing campaign ‚Äî and to remove the FBI Director from his office.",Foregin,

‚ÄúIn victory, magnanimity!‚Äù said Winston Churchill. 
Donald Trump should be magnanimous and gracious toward those whom he defeated this week, but his first duty is to keep faith with those who put their faith in him. 
The protests, riots and violence that have attended his triumph in city after city should only serve to steel his resolve. 
As for promptings that he ‚Äúreach out‚Äù and ‚Äúreassure‚Äù those upset by his victory, and trim or temper his agenda to pacify them, Trump should reject the poisoned chalice. This is the same old con. 
Trump should take as models the Democrats FDR and LBJ. 
Franklin Roosevelt, who had savaged Herbert Hoover as a big spender, launched his own New Deal in his first 100 days. 
History now hails his initiative and resolve. 
Lyndon Johnson exploited his landslide over Barry Goldwater in 1964 to erect his Great Society in 1965: the Voting Rights Act, Medicare and Medicaid. He compromised on nothing, and got it all. 
Even those who turned on him for Vietnam still celebrate his domestic achievements. 
President Nixon‚Äôs great regret was that he did not bomb Hanoi and mine Haiphong in 1969 ‚Äî instead of waiting until 1972 ‚Äî and bring the Vietnam War to an earlier end and with fewer U.S. casualties. 
Nixon‚Äôs decision not to inflame the social and political crisis of the ‚Äô60s by rolling back the Great Society bought him nothing. He was rewarded with media-backed mass demonstrations in 1969 to break his presidency and bring about an American defeat in Vietnam. 
‚ÄúAction this day!‚Äù was the scribbled command of Prime Minister Churchill on his notepads in World War II. This should be the motto of the first months of a Trump presidency. 
For the historic opportunity he and the Republican Party have been given by his stunning and unanticipated victory of Nov. 8 will not last long. His adversaries and enemies in politics and press are only temporarily dazed and reeling. 
This great opening should be exploited now. 
Few anticipated Tuesday morning what we would have today: a decapitated Democratic Party, with the Obamas and Clintons gone or going, Joe Biden with them, no national leader rising, and only the power of obstruction, of which the nation has had enough. 
The GOP, however, on Jan. 20, will control both Houses of Congress and the White House, with the real possibility of remaking the Supreme Court in the image of the late Justice Antonin Scalia. 
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and House Speaker Paul Ryan have indicated they are willing to work with President Trump. 
There is nothing to prevent the new GOP from writing history. 
In his first months, Trump could put a seal on American politics as indelible as that left by Ronald Reagan. 
A partial agenda: First, he should ignore any importunings by President Obama to permit passage of the Trans-Pacific Partnership in a lame-duck session ‚Äî and let the trade deal sink by year‚Äôs end. 
On Jan. 20, he should have vetted and ready to nominate to the high court a brilliant constitutionalist and strict constructionist. 
He should act to end interference with the Dakota Access pipeline and call on Congress to re-enact legislation, vetoed by Obama, to finish the Keystone XL pipeline. Then he should repeal all Obama regulations that unnecessarily restrict the production of the oil, gas and clean coal necessary to make America energy independent again. 
Folks in Pennsylvania, southeast Ohio, Kentucky and West Virginia should be shown, by executive action, that Trump is a man of his word. And when the mines open again, he should be there. 
He should order new actions to seal the Southern border, start the wall and begin visible deportations of felons who are in the country illegally. 
With a new education secretary, he should announce White House intent to work for repeal of Common Core and announce the introduction of legislation to put federal resources behind the charter schools that have proven to be a godsend to inner-city black children. 
He should propose an immediate tax cut for U.S. corporations, with $2 to $3 trillion in unrepatriated profits abroad, who will bring the money home and invest it in America, to the benefit of our economy and our Treasury. 
He should take the president‚Äôs phone and pen and begin the rewriting or repeal of every Obama executive order that does not comport with the national interest or political philosophy of the GOP. 
Trump should announce a date soon for repeal and replacement of Obamacare and introduction of his new tax-and-trade legislation to bring back manufacturing and create American jobs. 
Donald Trump said in his campaign that that this is America‚Äôs last chance. If we lose this one, he said, we lose the country. 
The president-elect should ignore his more cautious counselors, and act with the urgency of his declared beliefs.

"BEIRUT, Lebanon  ‚Äî   Hundreds of Syrian men who escaped   areas of eastern Aleppo to reach   parts of the city are missing, United Nations officials said on Friday, adding that they had received reports of government reprisals, including numerous arrests and several cases of summary killings of suspected supporters of the opposition. At the same time, the officials said, some rebel groups have prevented civilians from leaving and even killed or kidnapped those who demanded that insurgents leave their neighborhoods. The United Nations reports largely reflect what residents of East Aleppo have told The New York Times in recent days as Syrian government forces retook control of most of the city. Several have said family members were detained, arrested or conscripted after crossing into   areas, and one resident recounted how rebels in the Bustan   neighborhood stopped people from leaving. Other residents, however, said rebels had helped them cross the front lines or warned them not to go at certain times or in certain places because of the danger. Rebel groups inside east Aleppo are fragmented and do not always act in concert. As government forces continued to advance on Friday, panic was growing among those still trapped inside, who either could not make their way out or were afraid to enter government territory. More than 10, 500 people have left   areas in the last 24 hours, Russian officials said on Friday, nearly half of them children, while others have moved deeper into the   district under intense bombardment. At the same time, government forces have escorted hundreds of the displaced back to recently retaken districts, such as the Bab   district below. But those areas are heavily damaged, and officials have told families to move into any available abandoned apartments. In areas the government has recently retaken, like this one south of Aleppo, it has placed posters of President Bashar   amid rubble and handed out Syrian government flags. Many people who escaped eastern Aleppo have been filmed thanking government troops and their ally, Russia, and chanting praise for Mr. Assad. In the newly retaken Bab   neighborhood, a man greeted a   fighter. But for those viewed as opposing the government and men wanted for army service, there is a riskier side to entering government territory. Rupert Colville, a spokesman for the United Nations high commissioner for human rights, said family members had reported that they had lost contact with men aged 30 to 50, echoing several interviews The Times conducted in which Aleppo residents said their males relatives were arrested or forced to join the army. ‚ÄúGiven the terrible record of arbitrary detention, torture and enforced disappearances by the Syrian government, we are of course deeply concerned about the fate of these individuals,‚Äù Mr. Colville said. He also said that two members of the   forces that took over Aleppo‚Äôs   neighborhood were reported to have summarily shot four men in front of their families on Sunday because they were suspected of working with the opposition. The last two weeks have seen the fiercest bombardments yet of   districts. Those still inside describe chaos and intense crowding in some areas as people scramble for shelter.

Mr. Colville said the agency had heard reports that two armed opposition groups had abducted and killed an unknown number of civilians who asked them to leave their neighborhoods.

At its center is the citadel, which the government has held and used as a fortress throughout the conflict. The government‚Äôs offensive over the last week has left rebels in east Aleppo facing   defeat. On Friday, Russian officials said that 93 percent of Aleppo had been captured by the Syrian Army. There has been some talk of at least a temporary   to allow for evacuation of the city, but on Friday, the Russian foreign minister, Sergey V.

In practice, the resolution means little, with no specifics and no force of law. So Syria and Russia, which lobbied vigorously against the resolution, can continue their military operations, including those on the   parts of Aleppo. The resolution, advanced by Canada, received 122 votes in favor and 13 against.   members abstained. The no votes included Syria, its chief allies Iran and Russia, along with China, Cuba and Venezuela. It comes days after Russia, along with China, defeated a resolution in the Security Council that would have imposed a   cessation of hostilities to allow aid into besieged parts of Aleppo and allow residents to get out.",Foregin,
"OTTAWA  ‚Äî   The entire community of Fort McMurray, the heart of Alberta‚Äôs oil sands region, was ordered to evacuate on Tuesday night as a   wildfire advanced on the city and cut off its only highway link to the south. The fire destroyed a number of homes in one neighborhood and some trailers in a trailer park, said Robin Smith, a spokesman for the Regional Municipality of Wood Buffalo, which includes Fort McMurray. According to television news reports, commercial buildings downtown were also ablaze. There were no reports of injuries by early evening. A video  showed flames and smoke rising hundreds of feet into the sky, prompting the largest fire evacuation in Alberta‚Äôs history, The Edmonton Journal reported. The fire was expected to get worse on Wednesday, when winds were forecast to switch direction and increase in speed. Mr. Smith said early Tuesday that Highway 63, which connects Fort McMurray to Edmonton, Alberta, to the south and the main oil sands production areas to the north, was heavily congested with cars fleeing the fire, which began over the weekend. Late in the afternoon, however, the fire jumped over the highway, making evacuation to the south impossible, Mr. Smith said. He added that there was no immediate danger in areas north of Fort McMurray. The highway was later reopened. As of early Tuesday evening, the city‚Äôs airport was open, but some airlines were canceling flights, said Jillian Philipp, an airport spokeswoman. After leaving the airport earlier in the day, Ms. Philipp said she was unable to return because of the fire. But employees still there told her that it did not appear to be in the immediate path of the flames. The provincial government had ordered residents out of six neighborhoods and a trailer park by late in the afternoon after declaring the fire ‚Äúout of control. ‚Äù The fire had consumed about 6, 500 acres of forest by late Monday night and increased substantially in size by Tuesday, said Laura Stewart, a spokeswoman for the provincial government. Ms. Stewart said that strong, changing winds were shifting the fire‚Äôs direction, making it unsafe for firefighters on the ground. As a result, their efforts had been limited to aerial water bombing. A photograph posted by the government showed only a relatively small line of trees and a hill separating a commercial district from a tower of flame. Until last year, the oil sands had made Fort McMurray Canada‚Äôs boomtown, where the biggest concern was dealing with frenetic growth and the housing shortages and social problems it created. The collapse of oil prices, however, has hit the city particularly hard. Oil sands companies have been laying off workers as projects are completed, but no major oil sands projects have shut down. Last year, the regional municipality had a population of about 125, 000, excluding thousands of workers who officially claimed residency elsewhere but who commuted by air to Fort McMurray and lived in work camps.",Foregin,
"Syria This October 19, 2016 photo provided by Norwegian Armed Forces shows a plane taking off from Russian aircraft carrier Admiral Kuznetsov (R) with helicopters escorting nuclear-powered battle cruiser Pyotr Veliky (L) southwest of the city of Trondheim in international waters on its way to the Mediterranean. 
A fleet of Russian warships has entered the eastern Mediterranean off the coast of Syria amid speculations that Moscow and Damascus are about to launch a massive operation against terrorists in the northern Syrian city of Aleppo. 
The commander of Russian aircraft carrier Admiral Kuznetsov told state-owned Russia-1 television network on Saturday that the military vessels were positioned in the ‚Äúdesignated zone... in the eastern Mediterranean and are now jointly carrying out tasks, maneuvering to the west of the Syrian coast.‚Äù 
Captain 1st rank Sergei Artamonov added that fighter jets have already started taking off from the carrier‚Äôs deck to survey the conflict zone. 
‚ÄúFlights are being carried out from the deck... they are working on coordination with the shore port. The flights have been going on practically every day for the last four days,‚Äù the high-ranking Russian naval commander pointed out. 
The remarks came a day after Russia‚Äôs Interfax news agency reported that Russian MiG and Sukhoi warplanes routinely fly from the Kuznetsov aircraft carrier into the Syrian airspace to ‚Äúdetermine combat missions.‚Äù 
Meanwhile, the commander of the Pyotr Veliky nuclear-powered battle cruiser, Captain 1st rank Vladislav Malakhovsky, said on Saturday that no foreign aircraft dared to ‚Äúcome closer than 50 kilometers‚Äù away from the Russian fleet. This file photo shows Russian frigate Admiral Grigorovich on its way to the Mediterranean. (Photo by Reuters) 
On November 4, Russian frigate Admiral Grigorovich passed through the Bosphorus Strait in northwestern Turkey and arrived off the Syrian coast. 
Grigorovich is reportedly capable of launching land-attack Kalibr cruise missiles, which are equivalent to US Tomahawk ones and equipped with the latest high precision guidance systems. 
Russia has been bombing Daesh and Jabhat Fateh al-Sham, formerly known as the al-Nusra Front, terror groups in Syria since September 30, 2015 at the official request of President Bashar al-Assad. 
Backed by Russia‚Äôs aerial campaign, the Syrian troops have retaken several militant-held areas in the Arab country.

Do you think he should be investigated by the senate and should it be investigated by the inspector general at DOJ? yes. SCHUMER: Yes.

You know Attorney General Sessions has a higher obligation. He didn‚Äôt tell the truth meeting with the Russians so he recused himself.

"A movement is growing to bring together women across race, creed and political beliefs by luring them off social media and arranging for them to meet in person. It‚Äôs a nice idea, but there‚Äôs one catch: The Women‚Äôs March on Washington is being organized on Facebook, the nation‚Äôs preferred platform to battle over race, gender, politics and just about everything else. The timing of the event, which organizers began planning the morning after the election but are careful not to call a protest, is aimed at the coming administration of   Donald J. Trump. More than 100, 000 people have said on Facebook that they will travel to the capital to participate. The plan is to walk from the Lincoln Memorial to the White House on Jan. 21, 2017, the morning after Mr. Trump‚Äôs inauguration. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre doing it his very first day in office because we are making a statement,‚Äù one organizer, Breanne Butler, said. ‚ÄúThe marginalized groups you attacked during your campaign? We are here and we are watching. And, like, ‚ÄòWelcome to the White House.‚Äô ‚Äù Since Election Day, there has been momentum around supporting groups that are opposed to Mr. Trump‚Äôs espoused views on women and minority groups. Nonprofit organizations, including the Planned Parenthood Federation of America and the American Civil Liberties Union, have reported a surge in donations after the election. But the election taught Americans that women are deeply divided along party lines, education level and race: 53 percent of white women voted for Mr. Trump, according to exit poll data. On the march group‚Äôs Facebook page, it is easy to see how complicated the idea of the ‚Äúwomen‚Äôs vote,‚Äù an already mythological concept, has become, and how difficult it might be for organizers to fulfill their aim of gathering women who remain fiercely divided on reproductive rights, gun control,   marriage and immigration, among other issues. Not everyone on the page believes, for instance, that Hillary Clinton would have made a good president, or that Stephen K. Bannon, a chief strategist under Mr. Trump, holds divisive views about minorities. Debates over both have sprung up in recent days. Bob Bland, one of the march organizers, said in an email that organizers in Maryland had to change a Facebook page from public to private to protect the safety of women who want to attend. Evvie Harmon, a yoga teacher from Greenville, S. C. who is helping   efforts to organize for the march, said the group had nixed a possible idea for a slogan  ‚Äî   ‚ÄúHuman rights are women‚Äôs rights, and women‚Äôs rights are human rights‚Äù  ‚Äî   because it was something that Mrs. Clinton once said. ‚ÄúThis is not an   protest,‚Äù Ms. Harmon said. ‚ÄúThis is the reaction of women and minorities across the world who are very disturbed by the rhetoric that was said over the last year and a half. ‚Äù Aside from dueling political views, organizers are trying to take feedback from a cacophony of voices in real time as they try to assemble a network of state volunteers, plan programming and arrange transportation and lodging for the event. Ms. Butler, a chef who is organizing the event in her spare time, said the march had no official means of funding yet. There are women on the page who have said that the march is not inclusive enough, and that they don‚Äôt want an event organized by white women. Ms. Butler acknowledged the criticism but stressed that the women who are organizing are from different racial and religious backgrounds. (There was even controversy over the original name: Organizers have changed the name from Million Woman March to the Women‚Äôs March on Washington because observers took issue with the fact that the original name echoed a black women‚Äôs march held in Philadelphia in 1997.) Ms. Butler, 27, said the greater concern would be helping local groups raise money to help women who can‚Äôt afford to travel to Washington. ‚ÄúThe reality is that it‚Äôs incredibly expensive to fly to D. C. on inauguration weekend,‚Äù Ms. Butler said. ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt want only an   class of people at this march because no one else can afford to go. ‚Äù Tabitha St.   34, who plans to help sign up attendees by visiting churches, synagogues and community centers in New York City, said she had been working to include all types of people  ‚Äî   including those who have not been on Facebook lately. ‚ÄúI am a woman of color and I am an immigrant,‚Äù said Ms. St.   who lives in Brooklyn. She said of the march: ‚ÄúFor me, it has been completely inclusive. ‚Äù This is all plenty of pressure for a     movement without a concrete path to funding itself, but organizers are optimistic as they look ahead to January. According to Ms. Butler, the group‚Äôs request for a permit to march is still pending. On Friday, Michael Litterst, a spokesman for the National Park Service, said in an email that the group‚Äôs request to march is one of at least 13 requests currently under review for areas the agency administers in the nation‚Äôs capital. Those also include rallies and demonstrations. Mr. Litterst said the Park Service was also reviewing five requests for official inauguration events.",Foregin,

"Videos ‚ÄòAnti-Establishment‚Äô Trump Plans to Appoint Goldman Sachs and George Soros Insiders ‚ÄúI know the guys at Goldman Sachs. They have total, total control over him. Just like they have total control over Hillary Clinton.‚Äù Be Sociable, Share! Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump speaks during a campaign rally in Sunrise, Fla. 
Contrary to his anti-establishment stance ‚Äî which supporters readily boast as a viable alternative to Hillary Clinton ‚Äî Donald Trump‚Äôs establishment roots run so deep, the billionaire real estate mogul plans to appoint a former Goldman Sachs partner and George Soros Fund manager as Secretary of the Treasury should he win the election. 
Steve Mnuchin came on board Trump‚Äôs campaign as finance chair in May, raising eyebrows of many who felt his 17-year history with Sachs ‚Äî and affiliation with liberal globalist George Soros as an Investment Professional of Soros Fund Management ‚Äî conflicted directly with the then-presumptive nominee‚Äôs conservative stance and criticisms of establishment politicians. 
‚ÄúIt is difficult to see how a second-generation Goldman Sachs partner would secure such a prominent position in an administration delivered by a populist wind,‚Äù Compass Point analyst Isaac Boltansky told Politico of Trump‚Äôs curious choice for Treasury Secretary. 
According to Fox Business Network , Trump‚Äôs confidence in winning the White House has fomented enough to begin picking Cabinet members, and besides the anomalous choice of Mnuchin for the Treasury, sources said he‚Äôs considering New Jersey Governor Chris Christie for Attorney General and former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani for Homeland Security Secretary. 
Trump has, of course, expended great efforts in criticizing opponent Hillary Clinton‚Äôs deep ties to the banking and Wall Street elite; and prior to garnering the Republican nomination, extended that critique to competitor Ted Cruz, saying in one debate: 
‚ÄúI know the guys at Goldman Sachs. They have total, total control over him. Just like they have total control over Hillary Clinton.‚Äù 
Zero Hedge noted when Trump hired the left-leaning hedge fund manager and financier as finance chair that Mnuchin had previously donated multiple times to various Democrats, including Barack Obama and none other than Hillary Clinton. 
Further substantiating his establishing banking insider status ‚Äî the precise profile Trump claims publicly to loathe ‚Äî Mnuchin worked at Goldman Sachs for 17 years, headed OneWest Bank prior to its purchase by CIT Group in 2015, and now sits on CIT‚Äôs board while also serving as chairman and chief executive of Dune Capital Management, a private investment firm with a focus on financing big-time Hollywood movies, like ‚ÄúAvatar.‚Äù 
If Mnuchin‚Äôs Wall Street ties don‚Äôt trouble Trump‚Äôs supporters enough, the hedge fund manager‚Äôs links to George Soros ‚Äî an ardent Clinton fan ‚Äî certainly will. 
In fact, in terms of opposition, Soros has spent billions influencing global politics by inserting his brand of leftism wherever possible ‚Äî and earlier this year even pledged , with others, some $15 million specifically to mobilize Latinos and immigrants to defeat Donald Trump. 
‚ÄúSteven is a professional at the highest level with an extensive and very successful financial background,‚Äù Trump said upon bringing Mnuchin into his campaign. ‚ÄúHe brings unprecedented experience and expertise to a fundraising operation that will benefit the Republican Party and ultimately defeat Hillary Clinton.‚Äù 
Indeed, Trump‚Äôs campaign, quoted by the Daily Caller , said Mnuchin ‚Äúhas previously worked with Mr. Trump in a business capacity and brings his expertise in finance to what will be an extremely successful fundraising operation for the Republican Party.‚Äù 
While business dealings certainly bring ordinarily clashing personalities into contact on occasion, these details about the relationship between Trump and Mnuchin evidence the former‚Äôs links to the left. 
Despite the nominee‚Äôs many diatribes excoriating Hillary Clinton as out-of-touch with the American populace, Trump‚Äôs own status as a billionaire belies both their decades-old friendship and striking similarities ‚Äî particularly as darlings of the establishment. 
Should you choose to vote on the 8th, it would be prudent to keep in mind blustery campaign rhetoric ‚Äî from any politician ‚Äî only constitutes so much hot air.

"Statins my disrupt vascular function On the Greenmedinfo.com Statin Research database we have cataloged over 15 studies from the National Library of Medicine indicating the heart-damaging properties of this class of supposedly ‚Äòheart friendly‚Äô drugs. View our professional data page here , or if you are not a member, view the open access reference page for public view and linking here . Statins do not only reduce lipoprotein production but have so-called pleoitropic properties, which include immune system down-regulating and anti-inflammatory properties, which is why they are believed to have a small benefit in reducing the inflammatory burden caused by autoimmune processes in the artery that can precipitate myocardial infarction (heart attack) in some individuals ‚Äî but not without having the unintended, adverse effect of increasing cancer risk (at all sites) and contributing to congestive heart failure, effectively cancelling out the small, mostly theoretical benefit of reduced heart attack risk. For instance, it has been estimated that ‚Äú‚Ä¶at least 23,000 low-risk people would have to take statins for five years to prevent one death from heart disease.‚Äù [ Source ] Statins are also clearly diabetogenic , increasing the risk of type 2 diabetes by about 50% in some populations , with the FDA now requiring drug manufacturers to include a warning of diabetes risk on statin drug labels . Considering morbidity and mortality from type 2 diabetes is caused not by the elevated blood sugar in and of itself, but the damage glycated sugar does to the vascular system and the subsequent cardiovascular harm it produces, the case against using statins for primary and secondary prevention of heart disease seems clear as day. Moreover, cardiovascular harm is not the only concern. Statin drugs have been linked to over 300 adverse health effects. We issued a consumer alert on the topic several years ago . For the more technically minded, here is the database page on Statin drugs listing 300+ adverse health effects based on 465 published studies. Heart Disease Is Not Caused By A Lack of A Drug Should we be surprised to find so much research on this drug class‚Äôs adverse health effects? After all, cholesterol is fundamental for the health of each cell in the human body, and low cholesterol has been found to cause a wide range of health problems , including psychiatric states such as violence against self and other. The food and drug industries have used cholesterol phobia to manipulate health professionals and the lay public into believing that the cause of heart disease is genetic, and can only be addressed through the use of synthetic, patented, essentially toxic chemicals, i.e. pharmaceuticals, or eating semi-synthetic ‚Äòlow fat,‚Äô‚Äòlow cholesterol‚Äô foods with very little nutritional value. This latest study speaks to why we must exercise the precautionary principle when considering taking a patented chemical ‚Äì technically a xenobiotic alien to human physiology ‚Äì for suppressing a symptom of a much deeper and more complex problem. While oxidized cholesterol forms a significant part of the problem of atherosclerotic build-up in the arteries, it is not the primary cause of the damage to the inner lining of the arteries (endothelium), and the pre-existing endothelial dysfunction that can go on for many decades silently in the background. Ox-LDL deposits in atheromatous lesions have been viewed as an epiphenomenon, generated as part of a cascade of immune-mediated events the body activates in order to attempt to heal arterial damage. In certain respects, cholesterol deposits in the arteries at the site of damage can be likened to a Band-Aid. Do we blame the Band-Aid for causing the injury upon which it is placed? It is important to point out that oxidized cholesterol (ox-LDL) can be toxic and harmful to the vascular system, but the problem with modern blood testing for ‚Äòcholesterol‚Äô is that it does not take into the quality of the lipoproteins, only their quantitative dimensions. Depending on one‚Äôs diet, environmental factors, and overall bodily health, LDL particles will oxidize at different rates. If you are eating an antioxidant rich diet, full of healthy fats, phytocompounds, etc., your properly functioning LDL will be less susceptible to conversion to ox-LDL. On the other hand, eating a diet full of non-essential, oxidized fats, deficient in phytonutrients, antioxidants, etc. ‚Äì and adding in environmental toxins and toxicants, e.g. smoking ‚Äì will produce more ox-LDL, rendering it artherogenic. Obviously, therefore, diet and lifestyle form the basis for a sound preventive approach if the ‚Äò lipid hypothesis ‚Äò of cardiovascular disease is even deemed truly relevant. [For more research on natural substances which inhibit cholesterol oxidation, view our database on the topic: Prevent Cholesterol Oxidation .] Furthermore, there are many ways to address underlying vascular pathologies without suppressing the production of a vital building block and signaling molecule, which is what cholesterol is. Pomegranate , chocolate , and many other natural substances, have been confirmed in research to have profound heart disease preventive and reversing properties . You can explore our database sections relevant to the topic within our Heart Health guide , to find hundreds of studies proving this point. Basic nutritional incompatibilities, including the consumption of wheat which has cardiotoxic properties in genetically susceptible individuals, and excessive consumption of omega-6 versus omega-3 fats can profoundly increase the risk of heart disease. One groundbreaking study published last year, in fact, indicates that statins actually reduce the health benefits of omega-3 fats in the diet ‚Äì adding another mechanism by which statin drugs exert heart disease promoting effects . Beyond the Pharmaceutically-Driven Medical Paradigm If statin drugs are toxic to human sperm, and if the men within whom this statin-induced damage is occurring are of reproductive age, the implications of this latest study on statins and fertility are potentially devastating to the health of future generations. Changes in our species germlines ‚Äì sperm or egg ‚Äì are carried on to future generations, possibly forever. With recent research indicating that even changes to somatic cells in this lifetime are capable of transferring information to the sperm , what we do here and now ‚Äì our chemical exposures, our nutritional status, and even our psychospiritual and mental orientation (which gear into real physiological and genetic/epigenetic processes ‚Äì can have critical and irreversible affects on our offspring. Clearly, the time has come both to re-evaluate the role of pharmaceuticals in ‚Äòpreventive‚Äô health care, as well as the effects these novel new chemical compounds will have on the next generation, and the next.

"Good morning. (Want to get California Today by email? Here‚Äôs the  .) Today‚Äôs introduction comes to us from Adam Popescu, a reporter based in Los Angeles.  In turning the Trayvon Martin tragedy into a virtual reality film, the director Nonny de la Pe√±a combed through public court records and stitched together 911 calls to structure an auditory narrative of the rainy night that ended in the shooting death of the unarmed    by George Zimmerman. To get the look of the apartment complex in Sanford, Fla. where the events took place, Ms. de la Pe√±a, a former Newsweek correspondent who runs a virtual reality company in Santa Monica, found architectural drawings of the location online, designs that were then rendered as video   C. G. I. models. The final product, called ‚ÄúOne Dark Night,‚Äù was recently shown at Los Angeles‚Äô Hammer Museum and is now available on Google Play and Steam. ‚ÄúThis is immersive journalism,‚Äù she said, intended to drive empathy. But it also raises issues about taste and truth. I caught up with Ms. de la Pe√±a by phone. Here are some excerpts from the conversation: Q. How did this piece come together? A. ‚ÄúOne Dark Night‚Äù is sourced entirely from 911 calls, trial testimony and architectural drawings of the condo complex where the shooting took place. I‚Äôm still an investigative journalist at heart, and it was very much the kind of story I used to cover as a print reporter. I really wanted to make a piece about the shooting, to be able to cast any kind of additional spotlight on the case using V. R. Q. Why Trayvon Martin? Why not Freddie Gray or another tragedy? A. Nothing other than I had the ability and I had the time and I felt I was the person to do it. Something clicked when I began investigating the Trayvon case. Q. You say it‚Äôs meant to draw empathy. Do you acknowledge that videos of shootings can be interpreted in multiple ways, and that this piece is subject to such questions? A. Definitely. I‚Äôve had a journalist say that they better understood Zimmerman‚Äôs position. We‚Äôre always trying to figure out what we can convey to the viewer and what‚Äôs appropriate to show. For audiences not reading newspapers or watching broadcast TV, V. R. can reach them where they play. This is how you keep an informed global citizenry and keep democracy robust. What do we decide to shield them from? I think that that question is only going to be more pronounced as this media becomes more mature.

Dekmar, who is white, issued a rare apology for a Southern lynching. ‚ÄúI sincerely regret and denounce the role our Police Department played in Austin‚Äôs lynching, both through our action and our inaction,‚Äù Chief Dekmar told a crowd at a traditionally   church. ‚ÄúAnd for that, I‚Äôm profoundly sorry. It should never have happened. ‚Äù He also said that all citizens had the right to expect that their police department ‚Äúbe honest, decent, unbiased and ethical. ‚Äù ‚ÄúIn Austin‚Äôs case, and in many like his, those were not the police department values he experienced,‚Äù he said. The apology for the Sept. 8, 1940, killing is part of a renewed push across the American South to acknowledge the brutal mob violence that was used to enforce the system of racial segregation after Reconstruction: In a 2015 study, the Equal Justice Initiative, a nonprofit based in Montgomery, Ala. documented 4, 075 of what it called the ‚Äúracial terror lynchings‚Äù of blacks by white mobs in 12 Southern states from 1877 to 1950. The group has begun construction of a memorial to lynching victims in Montgomery, which could open by March 2018. To Chief Dekmar, however, the apology in the town he has called home since 1995 is about more than righting history‚Äôs wrongs. It is also an effort, in the age of the Black Lives Matter movement, to address some of the deepest roots of minority mistrust in the police, and create a better working relationship between officers and the community. ‚ÄúIt became clear that something needed to be done to recognize that some things we did in the past are a burden still carried by officers today,‚Äù Chief Dekmar said in a recent phone interview. ‚ÄúInstitutions are made up of people, and relationships go like this: Before you trust somebody, you need to know that they know that they did you wrong, and that you‚Äôre stepping up and apologizing for it. ‚Äù Chief Dekmar, 61, a New Jersey native raised in Oregon, embraces a view of law enforcement that extends beyond the narrow goals of protecting the good and locking up the bad. He tends to speak about his department as one organ of a broader social body, though one that is perhaps more exposed than others to its ills. He leads regular meetings of a ‚Äúcommunity outreach committee‚Äù in which he shares with other civic leaders what his officers see on the streets  ‚Äî   homelessness, juvenile delinquency, children with learning and literacy issues  ‚Äî   and looks for ways that various   entities might work together to solve them. He has also sought to address trust issues: The department, he said, has mandated the use of body cameras on officers for the last five years. The chief became familiar with the lynching of Mr. Callaway only about two or three years ago, when one of his officers overheard two older   women who were looking at old photos of the LaGrange police on display at the headquarters building. One woman said to the other, ‚ÄúThey killed our people. ‚Äù Chief Dekmar began researching the episode but found, he said, only ‚Äúsketchy reports‚Äù  ‚Äî   there was ‚Äúno investigation I could find, no arrest, no   by the media. ‚Äù Indeed, the details of the crime appear to have been deliberately obscured for the   residents of LaGrange. Then, in 2014, Jason M. McGraw, a student at the Northeastern University School of Law in Boston, wrote a research paper about the lynching. He noted that while newspapers around the country had reported that a band of masked whites had abducted Mr. Callaway, the local paper, The LaGrange Daily News, wrote only that Mr. Callaway had died ‚Äúas a result of bullets fired by an unknown person or group of individuals. ‚Äù The paper‚Äôs headline on the Sept. 9, 1940, article declared, ‚ÄúNegro Succumbs to Shot Wounds. ‚Äù Mr. Callaway is generally believed to have been 16 or 18 years old on Sept. 7, the day he was arrested and charged with trying to assault a white woman. According to Mr. McGraw‚Äôs research, six white men arrived at the jail that night with at least one gun, forced the jailer to open the cell and forced Mr. Callaway into a car. He was driven to a spot eight miles away and shot in the head and arms. He was later found by a roadside and taken to a hospital, where he died. Mr. McGraw noted that the investigation of Mr. Callaway‚Äôs death fell to the town‚Äôs police chief, J. E. Matthews, and the Troup County sheriff, E. V. Hillyer, but that an investigative report was never made public. Chief Dekmar has learned that generations of   were well aware of what happened. ‚ÄúThere are relatives here and people who still remember,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúEven if those people are not still alive, down through the generations, that memory is still alive. That‚Äôs a burden that officers carry. ‚Äù As Chief Dekmar learned more about the case, he decided that something must be done to acknowledge it. The city he has sworn to protect is less than 70 miles southwest of Atlanta. Before the Civil War, LaGrange was a wealthy hub in Georgia‚Äôs cotton kingdom: Troup County, of which LaGrange is the seat, had the state‚Äôs   number of slaves. Today, according to recent census figures, the city is about 48 percent black and 45 percent white. A Kia plant in nearby West Point, Ga. suggests an economic future for the area beyond the textile industry that once sustained it. But nearly one in three LaGrange residents live in poverty. Residents say race relations here, as in many multicultural American communities, run the gamut from friendly to frayed, depending on the day and the issue. When LaGrange College, a private liberal arts school in town, announced that it had invited Representative John Lewis, the Georgia Democrat, to speak at a Martin Luther King Jr. event scheduled for Thursday, protests poured in, in part because Mr. Lewis had questioned the legitimacy of President Donald J. Trump. On Thursday, some businesses around town bore signs promoting Mr. Lewis‚Äôs appearance, while some homes featured   signs declaring ‚ÄúBack the Blue. ‚Äù For the last two years or so, city and county residents, including Chief Dekmar, have been engaged in a program of racial reconciliation and racial  . At a monthly meeting this summer, Chief Dekmar approached the president of the county N. A. A. C. P. chapter, Ernest Ward, and asked if he would help set up a public apology for the lynching. Mr. Ward served on the police force for nearly two decades starting in the  . He acknowledged that some of his fellow black residents harbored an    attitude toward the police. ‚ÄúI lost many friends when I became a police officer,‚Äù he said, ‚Äúbecause they felt that I sold out. ‚Äù He was asked how much the apology would help with    police work. ‚ÄúI believe it‚Äôs a start,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúAnd it‚Äôs helped me to have a newfound respect for Chief Dekmar. ‚Äù ‚ÄúHistorically certain people in the white race don‚Äôt like to bring up the past when it may not show a good light on their ancestors,‚Äù Mr. Ward said. ‚ÄúAnd so they would prefer to keep things hidden. ‚Äù Chief Dekmar issued his apology to relatives of Mr. Callaway on Thursday night at Warren Temple United Methodist Church here. The month after the shooting, Mr. McGraw noted, a church minister named L. W. Strickland wrote to Thurgood Marshall, the future Supreme Court justice who was then a lawyer for the N. A. A. C. P. telling him that the local branch of the rights group had asked the authorities to look into the case, but that ‚Äúnothing is being done  ‚Äî   not even acknowledgment of our requests. ‚Äù Some white LaGrange residents said on Thursday that they were deeply skeptical about whether the apology would have any practical effect. They noted that the crime took place before most people here were even born. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt care if they apologize or don‚Äôt,‚Äù said Jessie East, 74, who works at a furniture and appliance shop. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not going to change a thing that happened 77 years ago. ‚Äù But to others, including one of Mr. Callaway‚Äôs relatives, the apology was a step toward healing. ‚ÄúI speak your name, Austin Callaway, and ask God for forgiveness for the people that did this inhumane thing to you,‚Äù Deborah Tatum, a descendant of Mr. Callaway, told the congregation. ‚ÄúSome might say ‚Äòforgiveness‚Äô? And I say to you that I believe God when he tells us that there is power and freedom in forgiveness. ‚Äù",Foregin,
"LOS ANGELES  ‚Äî   From the stars to the producers to the executives, no one involved with ‚ÄúThe People v. O. J. Simpson: American Crime Story‚Äù seemed to realize the significance of where they were celebrating their triumphant Emmy night after the awards ceremony Sunday. They were all at an   at an event space called Vibiana, about two blocks from the courthouse where the Simpson case was tried. A couple of decades later, the case was recreated on this FX program, which won the Emmy for best limited series, capping a big night for the show. When the Fox executive Dana Walden heard about the proximity of the courthouse to the party, she said, ‚ÄúThat just gave me chills,‚Äù a sentiment echoed by FX‚Äôs chief executive, John Landgraf, who called it ‚Äúa little chilling. ‚Äù But there was one person who understood the odd coincidence of ending up back where it all started, after a circuitous and sometimes torturous route. ‚ÄúI know where I am,‚Äù Marcia Clark, the prosecutor in the Simpson case, said, a little gravely. She was sitting on a couch, inches away from the actress Sarah Paulson, who was holding the Emmy she won for portraying Ms. Clark. Ms. Clark, who was Ms. Paulson‚Äôs guest at the Emmys, said she couldn‚Äôt help but think about how near the courthouse was on the ride over from the ceremony. It was a bitter reminder for Ms. Clark, who was ridiculed in the news media in the    ‚Äî   the perception being that she had blown the prosecution and let Mr. Simpson go free. She has found her public comeback only in the last year, after the explosive popularity of the series and the sympathetic portrayal from Ms. Paulson, who in her acceptance speech for her best actress award offered up a moving public apology to Ms. Clark. ‚ÄúThe world saw me in sound bites,‚Äù Ms. Clark said. ‚ÄúNow I feel like I‚Äôm more understood. ‚Äù As Ryan Murphy, the prolific television producer who shepherded this show, put it: ‚ÄúThe great story tonight is Marcia Clark finally won. ‚Äù And so did FX. At the Emmys, it‚Äôs usually an HBO night, and to a certain extent it was again: The premium cable channel won the best drama and comedy categories for a second consecutive year with ‚ÄúGame of Thrones‚Äù and ‚ÄúVeep. ‚Äù It also broke Comedy Central‚Äôs hold on the variety category, with a victory by John Oliver‚Äôs ‚ÄúLast Week Tonight. ‚Äô‚Äô But propelled by a category that FX is reinventing  ‚Äî   the limited series  ‚Äî   the network arguably stole the show, smashing the basic cable Emmy record by winning 18 awards over all. The previous record was eight awards. The FX show also won acting Emmys for Courtney B. Vance‚Äôs portrayal of the defense lawyer Johnnie Cochran and Sterling K. Brown‚Äôs depiction of another prosecutor, Christopher Darden. (Louie Anderson won his first Emmy for his role as the mother of Zach Galifianakis‚Äôs character in FX‚Äôs ‚ÄúBaskets. ‚Äù) Mr. Landgraf has said in the past that he feels like he has to play ‚ÄúMoneyball‚Äù to compete with his rivals. Last month, he said his budget was about a sixth the size of Netflix‚Äôs. (Netflix‚Äôs programming budget is about $6 billion, HBO‚Äôs is $3 billion, and FX‚Äôs is about $1 billion.) But despite that, FX outshined them on Sunday. The success of the O. J. show wasn‚Äôt a sure thing. For decades, Hollywood did everything it could to stay away from the Bronco chase, Judge Lance A. Ito and the trial, in what proved to be a divisive national episode. ‚ÄúLike most things, it‚Äôs a   in retrospect, but it wasn‚Äôt at the time,‚Äù said Brad Simpson, a producer of the show, with his Emmy in hand. ‚ÄúThere was such a heavy saturation of O. J. that nobody wanted to hear about it again. When we announced the show, all the comments were, ‚ÄòOh lord, don‚Äôt put the country through this again.‚Äô But the show touched on things that obsesses America: class, race, the criminal justice system. ‚Äù By turning it into a limited series, which requires a relatively easy time commitment, FX was able to attract actors including John Travolta, Cuba Gooding Jr. and David Schwimmer. (All were nominated for awards on Sunday night.) And though the Academy Awards have been criticized for their   lineup of acting nominees, the Emmys have done better with diversity: Three   won acting awards on Sunday, including Mr. Vance and Mr. Brown from ‚ÄúThe People v. O. J. Simpson. ‚Äù ‚ÄúActors and directors follow the writing,‚Äù Mr. Vance said at the party. ‚ÄúThe writers in TV are writing for different hues of color. Hopefully the movies start to see that if you want to get the people, you better do the writing. ‚Äù Mr. Murphy, the producer, has been a regular at the Emmys (he‚Äôs the man behind shows including ‚ÄúGlee,‚Äù ‚Äú ‚Äù and ‚ÄúAmerican Horror Story‚Äù) and he said that between the diversity onstage and the large number of   winners, Sunday night‚Äôs ceremony represented ‚Äúa sea change. ‚Äù ‚ÄúI feel like sometimes you go to those award shows, and there are some people who win over and over again, but it wasn‚Äôt that type of night,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThe Television Academy and the voters have moved onto a different feeling, a different embrace, and it felt good. ‚Äù There was arguably nobody who benefited more on Sunday night than Ms. Clark. Though Ms. Paulson was joined at the hip with Ms. Clark on Sunday, the two did not meet until late in production. They‚Äôve become close since then, and Ms. Paulson provided one of the night‚Äôs stirring moments when she apologized to Ms. Clark during her acceptance speech, saying that the public in the 1990s was ‚Äúsuperficial and careless. ‚Äù Ms. Clark seemed to be enjoying the rehabilitation of her reputation. ‚ÄúI think the benefit of this   was people got to see the fullness of everyone involved,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúNot just me. Chris Darden, too. Everyone. As well as the historical context. I think everybody got more of what was going on, more than they did ever before. ‚Äù For two hours, Ms. Clark and Ms. Paulson sat cozily in a corner near Mr. Murphy and the ‚ÄúNarcos‚Äù star Pedro Pascal. At a little before midnight, Ms. Paulson got up to leave with Ms. Clark. As they walked through a courtyard, a group of young women were gawking at them, but they weren‚Äôt interested in the one holding the Emmy. ‚ÄúOh my God, that‚Äôs Marcia Clark!‚Äù one woman said. Ms. Clark heard it, looked over, pointed triumphantly and waved. She walked out of the party and toward an S. U. V. with Ms. Paulson, and just a few blocks away from her first brush with fame, Ms. Clark finally had her Hollywood ending.",Foregin,
"LONDON  ‚Äî   ‚ÄúGet on with it. ‚Äù With those words late in a major speech on Tuesday, Prime Minister Theresa May charted Britain‚Äôs course toward a clean break with the European Union and expressed her fondest hope: that the time for ‚Äúdivision and discord‚Äù is over. Her   speech outlined what promised to be a hugely complex,   negotiation, and it defined the broad objectives, but not the details, of British withdrawal. ‚ÄúThe United Kingdom is leaving the European Union, and my job is to get the right deal for Britain as we do,‚Äù she said. With the address, Mrs. May began the jockeying that will lead to a break after more than four decades of tight integration, and define Britain‚Äôs relations with its neighbors for decades to come. She confirmed that Britain is determined to regain control of migration from the European Union and rejected the supremacy of the European Court of Justice. That stance is anathema to the European Union, which has made the free movement of people  ‚Äî   as well as goods, capital and services  ‚Äî   a bedrock principle and which relies on the court to arbitrate. ‚ÄúLet me be clear,‚Äù Mrs. May said, acknowledging the differences. ‚ÄúWhat I am proposing cannot mean remaining in the single market. ‚Äù She said that she hoped to complete a final deal with the European Union by March 2019 and that it would be voted on by both houses of Parliament. She was not clear about what would happen if Parliament rejected the deal, though some speculated that a rejection would result in the sort of chaotic, ‚Äúcliff edge‚Äù breakup that she and Britain‚Äôs bankers and business leaders hoped to avoid. Mrs. May struck a diplomatic note, including an appeal for a new partnership with Continental Europe, but not at all costs. ‚ÄúWe seek a new and equal partnership  ‚Äî   between an independent,   global Britain and our friends and allies in the E. U.,‚Äù Mrs. May said. ‚ÄúNot partial membership of the European Union, associate membership of the European Union, or anything that leaves us half in, half out. ‚Äù And she appealed to Britons, especially to those in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, to unite behind the government and stop refighting the referendum that backed leaving the bloc, which she had opposed. The reaction among her opponents in the ‚Äúremain‚Äù camp was predictably harsh and seemed to herald a long and bruising process. ‚ÄúTheresa May has confirmed Britain is heading for a hard Brexit,‚Äù said Tim Farron, the leader of the centrist Liberal Democrats. ‚ÄúShe claimed people voted to leave the single market. They didn‚Äôt. She has made the choice to do massive damage to the British economy. ‚Äù The Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, accused the Tories of turning Britain into ‚Äúa   tax haven,‚Äù with their recent threat to slash corporate taxes if a good deal cannot be reached with the European Union. The speech, which provided some degree of substance, gained a warmer reception in the markets, with the pound seeming to stabilize after several jittery days. It rose as much as 1 percent against the dollar during her speech, while stocks on the London exchange fell. Supporters of a withdrawal have been encouraged as well by reports that other countries in the bloc have recognized that they might suffer if there was a complete rupture and they were denied access to London‚Äôs financial services sector. But British businesses remained nervous. Carolyn Fairbairn, director general of the Confederation of British Industry, a business lobbying group, welcomed the greater clarity provided by Mrs. May but worried that ‚Äúruling out membership of the single market has reduced options for maintaining a   trading relationship between the U. K. and the E. U. ‚Äù Kallum Pickering, senior Britain economist at Berenberg Bank in London, was more blunt, writing in an analysis that ‚Äúas we do not expect the E. U. to compromise its principles, the U. K. is set to face significant economic consequences from Brexit. ‚Äù Few analysts expect the negotiations to go as smoothly or as quickly as Mrs. May seemed to say in her speech. In recognition of the troubles that may lie ahead, Mark Boleat, the policy chairman for the City of London Corporation, the heart of Britain‚Äôs financial services industry, urged Mrs. May to swiftly secure a transition deal that would provide the certainty that businesses crave. Charles Brasted, a partner at Hogan Lovells, an international law firm, cautioned that the deal Mrs. May wanted was likely to be seen by the European Union as ‚Äúprecisely the cherry picking that they have warned against. ‚Äù He added: ‚ÄúThe objectives are now clear. The path towards them is uncharted. ‚Äù But he warned that ‚Äúevery one of the aspirations expressed by the U. K. government today will demand exceptional political skill to negotiate and will be complex to implement legally and commercially. ‚Äù In Europe, Donald Tusk, the president of the European Council, said on Twitter: ‚ÄúSad process, surrealistic times but at least more realistic announcement on #Brexit. ‚Äù Germany‚Äôs foreign minister,   Steinmeier, welcomed Mrs. May‚Äôs ‚Äúdesire for a positive and constructive partnership, a friendship with a strong E. U.,‚Äù which Germany would reciprocate. Mrs. May‚Äôs speech, delivered in the grand surroundings of Lancaster House in London, was the most closely watched statement on European policy since January 2013, when the prime minister at the time, David Cameron, promised to hold a referendum on European Union membership. The prospect that Britain would remain part of the single market has been fading since Mrs. May said in October that she would demand complete control of migration from the European Union and release from the European Court of Justice. The extent to which Mrs. May would be willing to compromise to maintain some access to the single market and to the customs union for goods was less clear. Membership in the customs union limits the ability of member countries to strike individual   deals with   nations. So she said she wanted a deal that would allow Britain to trade freely with the world, but still have as much   trade as possible with European Union countries. Ideally, Britain would like to have its cake and eat it, in the memorable phrase of the foreign secretary, Boris Johnson. In other words, Britain would reject what it disliked about the bloc, like freedom of movement, but keep trade unencumbered as it tried to get the best possible trading deal consistent with its other objectives. While European nations are expected to be stingy with market access, Mr. Pickering says he believes they will eventually bend. In the final deal, he wrote, he still expects Britain and the European Union to agree to a deal in which ‚Äúthe U. K. maintains a good level of access to the E. U.‚Äôs goods markets and limited access to the   services markets. ‚Äù ‚ÄúCrucially, we expect the U. K. to lose its E. U. financial services passport,‚Äù Mr. Pickering wrote, referring to a system that allowed banks based in Britain to offer financial services throughout the bloc. ‚ÄúThis follows from the U. K. raising some modest barriers to migration from the E. U. ‚Äù Many European Union countries have backed taking a hard line against Britain to send a message to other member states that might consider leaving. Anticipating that, Mrs. May said that Britain wanted a successful European Union and a friendly partnership, but that ‚Äúno deal for Britain is better than a bad deal for Britain. ‚Äù",Foregin,
"Since he was a boy he has hated black men. A bitter hatred of black men that boiled in his mind and consumed him. Then last week, apparently, he decided to kill them. This was the   investigators say they gathered of James Harris Jackson, a morose and seemingly directionless    white man who lived in Baltimore and had been having trouble getting rooted since leaving the Army. He had registered few obvious traces of who he was and what he stood for. Those who intersected with him found him to be a disagreeable and solitary figure who waved away contact with others. By all accounts, Timothy Caughman, 66, was a benevolent man content with an unassuming life. He lived in a former single room occupancy residence that had been his longtime home. The son of a home health care aide and a pastor, he had worked in antipoverty programs in Queens. Religion and philosophy were constants in his conversations over unhurried meals of turkey bacon and grits at local diners. In recent years, he had caught the familiar New York infatuation with celebrities and delighted in collecting their autographs and pictures. On St. Patrick‚Äôs Day, Mr. Jackson boarded a bus in Washington and rode it to New York. There were black men everywhere, and he told investigators he contemplated going elsewhere, but settled on New York because of the flood of media there. His goal was to draw the widest possible attention to his murderous plan. He made his statement of what hate looks like late on Monday night when the authorities said he pulled out a sword and fatally stabbed Mr. Caughman. He had been scavenging for cans in Midtown Manhattan around the corner from his home. Presumably, Mr. Jackson had little intention of getting away with it. Just after midnight on Wednesday, he surrendered to the police and took responsibility for the murder. He was arraigned on Thursday in Supreme Court in Manhattan and charged with   murder as a hate crime. He was ordered held without bail. The attack comes at a particularly anxious moment in America as hate crimes are on the rise in the country and especially in New York City. Both Mayor Bill de Blasio and Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo forcefully condemned the killing. At the arraignment, Joan Illuzzi, the prosecutor, said that Mr. Jackson was particularly offended by black men who were with white women. She told the judge that additional charges may be filed, including murder in the first degree, ‚Äúas this is an act, most likely, of terrorism. ‚Äù Dressed in a Tyvek suit, handcuffed and his legs in shackles, Mr. Jackson sneered several times as the charges were read. At one point, he gazed at the ceiling as though bored. He did not enter a plea. Sam Talkin, Mr. Jackson‚Äôs defense lawyer, declined to comment on the specifics of the case. ‚ÄúWe just need for the dust to settle,‚Äù he said. If the information put forth by the authorities is accurate, he added, they will have to deal with Mr. Jackson‚Äôs ‚Äúobvious psychological issues. ‚Äù The investigation into Mr. Jackson is still in its early stages and much remains unknown. But pieces of his life  ‚Äî   and of the man he is accused of killing  ‚Äî   were beginning to come together. Thus far, investigators have not linked Mr. Jackson to any white supremacy or hate group. Their sense is that he‚Äôs a discontent, not unlike many others who carry out senseless killings. But he was blunt about his prejudices when questioned by detectives. According to a law enforcement official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity since the investigation is continuing, ‚ÄúHe told the cops, ‚ÄòI‚Äôve hated black men since I was a kid. I‚Äôve had these feelings since I was a young person. I hate black men. ‚Äô‚Äù Mr. Jackson told detectives, according to the official, that his intention was to keep on killing, the first attack being a springboard. At one point during his interrogation, he said he thought about grabbing a police officer‚Äôs gun and using it to shoot others. Investigators have not yet determined the origins of this hate. Mr. Jackson told them that he had written his beliefs down and was going to deliver his writings to The New York Times. ‚ÄúHe said, ‚ÄòListen, I wrote this all down, it‚Äôs in my laptop,‚Äô‚Äù the law enforcement official said. He apparently grew up in Baltimore. In 2007, he graduated from the Friends School of Baltimore, a small and prestigious Quaker day school. Matt Micciche, the head of school, said the campus community was ‚Äúshocked and saddened by the news of this horrific attack. ‚Äù ‚ÄúOur school  ‚Äî   and the Religious Society of Friends  ‚Äî   has a long history of commitment to diversity, racial equality, social justice and nonviolence,‚Äù Mr. Micciche said in a statement. ‚ÄúThe entire Friends School community extends our deepest sympathy to the family and friends of Timothy Caughman. ‚Äù In March 2009, Mr. Jackson joined the Army and served at various locations in the United States, working in military intelligence. He was deployed to Afghanistan between December 2010 and November 2011. Afterward, he was stationed in Baumholder, Germany, before being discharged in August 2012, when his rank was specialist. During his service, the Army said, he received several awards. It‚Äôs unclear what he did after leaving the Army, though he seemed lost. In the spring of 2015, he was nearly evicted from an apartment building in Baltimore‚Äôs Mount Vernon neighborhood for falling behind on his rent, according to Marcus Dagan, who was filling in then as the building‚Äôs manager. Speaking by phone from Omaha, where he now lives, Mr. Dagan said Mr. Jackson occupied a   apartment and was at least six months in arrears. Mr. Dagan described him as a ‚Äúslob‚Äù and a ‚Äúdeadbeat,‚Äù who refused to let anyone inside his apartment and never engaged in the building‚Äôs social atmosphere. ‚ÄúHe turned into the tenant from hell,‚Äù Mr. Dagan said. He began eviction proceedings, but Mr. Jackson left before they were completed. The apartment, Mr. Dagan said, was the most disgusting thing the person hired to clean it had ever seen. ‚ÄúHe definitely had some issues of some kind,‚Äù Mr. Dagan said. ‚ÄúHow do you describe it? He was off. ‚Äù Yet he said he had never heard Mr. Jackson say anything that could be construed as racist. ‚ÄúNever had an intimation of that,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWhen you shake hands with somebody you can guess the character,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIn his case, you‚Äôd get like three fingers and a cold fish. ‚Äù Mr. Jackson‚Äôs most recent address was a   house wedged into a narrow street lined with rowhouses in the Hampden neighborhood of Baltimore, just west of Johns Hopkins University, a historic area that is filled with restaurants and shops. No one answered the door at the home on Thursday. A patrol car from the Baltimore Police Department was posted outside. Members of Mr. Jackson‚Äôs family appeared to be together in his parents‚Äô home in a gated community several miles away. On Thursday afternoon, his family issued a brief statement through a lawyer: ‚ÄúOur family is shocked, horrified and heartbroken by this tragedy. We extend our prayers and condolences to the family of Timothy Caughman. We have no further comments at this time and ask that our privacy be respected. ‚Äù After Mr. Jackson got to New York last Friday, he checked into the Hotel at Times Square on West 46th Street, using an assumed name. As far as the police know, he attacked no one else during those first days. As best they can tell, he was hunting. His weapon was a sword, and he carried two smaller knives. From surveillance cameras, investigators managed to track some of his movements, though there are gaps. In one video, he can be seen tailing a black man. When detectives questioned Mr. Jackson, they said he acknowledged zeroing in on that man but didn‚Äôt strike because there were too many people around. Late Monday evening, he found a target on a Midtown street corner. Timothy Caughman was bent over some garbage. Like many New Yorkers living spare lives in their retirement years, Mr. Caughman was once someone else, his identity not defined by empty pockets and a modest address. He was born in Jamaica, Queens, and grew up in a comfortable apartment in the South Jamaica Houses. One of his cousins said the family has roots in Georgia dating back to the 1700s when their ancestors were first brought to America as slaves. He was the son of Tula Caughman, a home health care aide for wealthy residents of nearby Jamaica Estates, and William Caughman, the pastor of Mount Zion Baptist Church. Growing up, he was called Hard Rock, for he knew his way around a boxing ring  ‚Äî   and a street fight. ‚ÄúHe was known in the community as not to be someone who started a fight, but if you started it, he finished it,‚Äù said one of his cousins. According to Seth Peek, another cousin, Mr. Caughman earned an associate degree after attending college in Brooklyn and Staten Island. For several years in Queens, Mr. Caughman ran a division of the Neighborhood Youth Corps, a federal antipoverty program designed to provide   jobs to poor youths. ‚ÄúHe probably gave out about two or three thousand jobs to people in the community,‚Äù said one of his cousins. He also freely contributed homespun advice on how to excel: ‚Äú‚ÄòIf you know that someone is going to be somewhere, and you want to meet them, you got to be there an hour early,‚Äô‚Äù the cousin recalled Mr. Caughman instructing him. Later, he held a succession of jobs, including as a concert promoter. He was particularly proud of booking an early gig by Earth Wind  Fire, before they attained fame, his cousin said. For the last 20 years, he lived in a room at the Barbour Hotel on West 36th Street that now houses formerly homeless people transitioning to permanent housing. Svein Jorgensen, the chief executive of Praxis Housing Initiatives, which manages the Barbour, said that of the   residents, Mr. Caughman was one of the few who were actually permanent tenants and not part of the transient program. In reports of the murder, Mr. Caughman was incorrectly assumed to be homeless. ‚ÄúHe was an extremely gracious individual and respectful of his neighbors,‚Äù Mr. Jorgensen said. He read avidly, and mainly kept to himself. He was a recycler of redeemables, his currency for his modest wants. His relatives said he viewed this as an entrepreneurial undertaking, a way to keep active and help pay for his room. He did maintain a social media presence.

On his Twitter feed, sandwiched between posts about celebrity culture, are links to articles about preventing cholesterol in babies and others about autism, echoing his broad interests.

One day he requested a photo of her, and she mailed him an autographed photo. ‚ÄúWhat kind of world are we living in right now?‚Äù she said, overcome with emotion. ‚ÄúWhat a harmless guy.

The man withdrew a sword from beneath his coat. A woman heard commotion, but didn‚Äôt realize what was actually happening and she ran off. But she told detectives she heard Mr. Caughman say, ‚ÄúWhy are you doing this? What are you doing?‚Äù",Foregin,
"WASHINGTON  ‚Äî   Michael T. Flynn, the national security adviser who was forced out of the job in February, failed to list payments from   entities on the first of two financial disclosure forms released Saturday by the Trump administration. The first form, which he signed in February, does not directly mention a paid speech he gave in Moscow, as well as other payments from companies linked to Russia. The second, an amended version, lists the names of the companies that made the payments under a section for any nongovernment compensation that exceeds $5, 000 ‚Äúin a year. ‚Äù That list appears to include all of the work that Mr. Flynn, a retired   Army general, has done since leaving the military in 2014, without providing compensation figures for any of it. No reason was given for the discrepancy between the two forms. The   payments were detailed in a letter released in March by congressional investigators, and included a $45, 000 speaking fee from RT, formerly known as Russia Today, a   news network, for a speech in 2015 in Moscow. During the same trip, Mr. Flynn attended the network‚Äôs lavish anniversary dinner and was photographed sitting at the elbow of President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia. Mr. Flynn has faced fierce criticism for the Moscow speech and for his lobbying efforts for Turkey. But the work paid well, and the disclosure forms showed income of nearly $1. 5 million, a sizable amount for a man who left the military less than three years ago. What Mr. Flynn, who spent most of his adult life earning a military officer‚Äôs salary, does not appear to possess is the kind of   investment portfolio enjoyed by most wealthy Americans, including the numerous millionaires and billionaires in the Trump administration. His form listed assets valued at $380, 000 and $800, 000, most of which is tied up in retirement funds. Mr. Flynn reported an income of $1. 37 million to $1. 47 million. The bulk  ‚Äî   $827, 055  ‚Äî   came from the Flynn Intel Group, the consulting business he founded after being pushed out as the chief of the Defense Intelligence Agency in 2014. The rest included speaking fees and income earned for doing consulting work and sitting on corporate boards, such as that of Adobe Systems, which paid him $125, 250. The speaking fees, all of which were from 2016, ranged from about $10, 000 to about $22, 000. He gave talks to relatively     groups like the Lincoln Chamber of Commerce in Nebraska, but also to the David Horowitz Freedom Center in California, which the Southern Poverty Law Center describes as an   hate group. It is unlikely that Mr. Flynn, who is seeking immunity from congressional and federal investigations into Russia‚Äôs meddling in the election, will match the same income this year. He shuttered the Flynn Intel Group at the end of 2016, and then was forced out of the White House in February for misleading Vice President Mike Pence about the nature of phone calls he had with the Russian ambassador to the United States in December. The payments for lobbying work that Mr. Flynn did for the Turkish government  ‚Äî   and did not disclose until March  ‚Äî   were handled through the Flynn Intel Group, and are not listed separately on the disclosure forms. Mr. Flynn did not work directly for the Turkish government the firm that hired him, Inovo, is owned by a   businessman with links to leaders in Ankara and asked him to work on an issue important to the government.",Foregin,
"Society US Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas 
A female lawyer has accused US Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas of sexually assaulting her in 1999, a report says. 
Moira Smith, who works as a corporate lawyer with an Alaska energy company, said the judge made unwanted sexual advances on her during a dinner party when she was 23-year-old, the National Law Journal reported on Thursday. 
She said Thomas grabbed and squeezed her buttocks several times during the party in Falls Church, Virginia. 
‚ÄúJustice Thomas touched me inappropriately and without my consent,‚Äù Smith said. 
‚ÄúHe groped me while I was setting the table, suggesting I should sit ‚Äòright next to him,‚Äô‚Äù Smith said. 
‚ÄúHe was 5 or 6 inches down and he got a good handful and he kept squeezing me and pulling me close to him,‚Äù she stated, according to the journal. 
In a statement to the National Law Journal, Thomas, 68, dismissed the allegation as ‚Äúpreposterous‚Äù, saying that the incident ‚Äúnever happened."" 
Smith, currently vice president and general counsel at Enstar Natural Gas Co in Alaska, said she decided to speak out after hearing Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump's lewd comments about women. 
A 2005 video was released earlier this month by The Washington Post, in which Trump can be heard making lewd comments about women and bragging about groping them. 
A number of women have since come forward claiming that the business mogul has sexually assaulted them. 
Trump has called the allegations ‚Äúslander and libel‚Äù and part of a ‚Äúconcerted, coordinated and vicious attack‚Äù by Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton and the news media to undercut his campaign. Moira Smith said Justice Clarence Thomas groped her at her boss' dinner party when she was 23. 
""That willingness by men in power to take advantage of vulnerable women relies on an unspoken pact that the women will not speak up about it,"" Smith, now 41, told the journal. 
""Why? Because they are vulnerable. Because they are star-struck. Because they don't want to be whiners. Because they worry about their career if they do speak out. But silence no longer feels defensible; it feels complicit,‚Äù she stated. 
""As the mother of a young daughter and son, I am coming forward to show that it is important to stand up for yourself and tell the truth,"" Smith said. 
Thomas was nominated to the top court in 1991 by Republican President George H.W. Bush. Loading ...",Foregin,
"A federal judge threw out a convicted D. C. sniper‚Äôs four life sentences Friday because he was 17 when he was originally sentenced. [U. S. District Judge Raymond Jackson in Norfolk, Virginia, ruled that Lee Boyd Malvo has a right to be   in new sentencing hearings due to a 2012 Supreme Court ruling that made it unconstitutional for juveniles to receive mandatory life sentences in prison without parole, the Daily Mail reported.  Malvo, now 32, was arrested in 2002 for his role in several shootings in the District of Columbia, Maryland, and Virginia that left ten dead and injured three. The attacks were widely covered in U. S. and international media over concerns that the sniper attacks, which were carried out from a modified car trunk, were acts of terrorism. Malvo entered a guilty plea in Spotsylvania County, Virginia, and agreed to two sentences of life in prison without parole. A judge in Fairfax County, Virginia, also sentenced him to two additional life terms in Fairfax County. In 2012, the Supreme Court ruled it was unconstitutional for courts to issue mandatory life sentences without parole to juvenile offenders. The Supreme Court further ruled in 2016 that the 2012 ruling could be applied retroactively to all sentences before the 2012 ruling. Jackson, as a result of these two rulings, threw out the four life sentences and ordered that Malvo be   in the counties of Fairfax and Spotsylvania. The Virginia attorney general, however, can appeal Jackson‚Äôs ruling, according to Fairfax County prosecutor Ray Morrogh, who prosecuted Malvo in 2003. The Virginia Attorney General‚Äôs Office is ‚Äúreviewing the decision and will do everything possible, including a possible appeal, to make sure this convicted mass murderer serves the life sentences that were originally imposed,‚Äù Michael Kelly, a spokesman for Virginia Attorney General Mark Herring, said Friday. Kelly added that Malvo could still be   to life in prison based on the convictions even if he is granted a new sentencing hearing. Defense lawyers for Malvo, however, have argued that he was an adolescent who did not know any better and was influenced by his older accomplice, John Allen Muhammad, USA Today reported. They remain hopeful that these new court hearings might give him a shot at parole. The Washington Post reported that Jackson‚Äôs ruling does not apply to Malvo‚Äôs six life sentences in Maryland that he received after pleading guilty to six counts of murder there, but Malvo‚Äôs Maryland lawyers are trying to appeal his convictions based on the Supreme Court rulings at the state and county levels. A hearing is set for June in that state.",Foregin,
"Here are the week‚Äôs top stories, and a look ahead. 1.   Donald Trump filled some top national security posts last week, naming loyalists who reflect his campaign‚Äôs   views. His choice for attorney general is Senator Jeff Sessions, above, who was blocked from becoming a federal judge in 1986 because of accusations of racially charged remarks. Michael Flynn, a retired lieutenant general who sees Islamic militancy as an existential threat, will be national security adviser. Representative Mike Pompeo of Kansas was nominated to be the director of the C. I. A. Here‚Äôs our latest coverage of Mr. Trump‚Äôs transition to the White House. ____ 2. ‚ÄúBuild something  . Something Americans can be proud of. ‚Äù That‚Äôs our   columnist, urging Mr. Trump to follow a lofty vision for his pledged upgrade of the country‚Äôs aging infrastructure. We even have a list of 10 projects, balanced between red and blue states, where he could leave his mark while helping unify a bitterly divided America. ____ 3. In the days after the election, our reporters and photographers fanned out across the country as a new political reality set in. They returned with a portrait of a country at odds with itself. We‚Äôre also beginning a podcast of  conversations among siblings,   classmates and friends who voted for different candidates. ‚ÄúI could never believe you‚Äôre a racist, man, that‚Äôs silly, that‚Äôs stupid,‚Äù said one young black man to a friend of Hispanic heritage who supported Mr. Trump. ‚ÄúCan‚Äôt believe you‚Äôre sexist. Cannot. But part of me is puzzled. ‚Äù Here are 19 questions to ask loved ones who voted differently. ____ 4. President Obama will return to the United States on Monday after the last major foreign trip of his presidency, with stops in Greece, Germany and Peru. On Tuesday, he‚Äôll give the 2016 Presidential Medal of Freedom to 21 recipients, including Kareem   Ellen DeGeneres, Tom Hanks and Bill and Melinda Gates. And on Wednesday he‚Äôll pardon a turkey for the last time as president. ____ 5. Seventeen new cardinals received their ‚Äúred hats‚Äù at a ceremony Saturday, officially joining the Roman Catholic Church‚Äôs College of Cardinals. Who Pope Francis selects for the college is critical to his efforts to reshape the church, as the group will eventually elect Francis‚Äô successor. Three Americans are among the new additions, the most Francis named from any one country. And while U. S. politics is never a determining factor in who is selected, all three men have been outspoken opponents of Republican Party positions. ____ 6. In Tunisia, where the Arab Spring began six years ago, the voices of torture victims and their loved ones are being heard. The   public hearings are an effort to salve the wounds from nearly 60 years of dictatorship. Mothers demanded justice for sons who were shot to death during the protests that ushered in democracy, and former prisoners described being tortured, humiliated and even forced to engage in homosexual acts. ____ 7. The skyline of New York City has changed drastically over the past decade. We‚Äôve gathered a number of notable new buildings that you may recognize (like 1 World Trade Center) or may not (um, a salt shed? ). Think you know the city‚Äôs recent additions pretty well? Here‚Äôs a quiz to test your knowledge. It includes the hyperbolic paraboloid, or   pyramid, above. ____ 8. Scientists who drilled into what is considered ground zero of the dinosaur extinction found something that surprised them: granite. The drilling happened in the Gulf of Mexico, where some 66 million years ago an asteroid crashed into Earth with the energy of 100 million atomic bombs. It left behind a    scar known as the Chicxulub crater, shown in an artist‚Äôs rendering above. Their finding suggests that powerful impacts can catapult materials buried deep in a planet‚Äôs crust much closer to its surface. ____ 9. After  Thursday‚Äôs Thanksgiving turkey, people across America will head to big box stores and camp out in preparation for ‚Äúdoorbuster‚Äù deals to kick off Black Friday shopping. Ah, the holiday season. But whatever your shopping strategy is, there are some innovative ways to save a buck. Like triggering retailers to email you coupons by filling up a virtual shopping cart, then fully logging out of the site. Here are some other tips, and a guide to not overpaying on Black Friday. ____ 10. Finally, a story about Thanksgiving. Specifically, the story of a    homesick college student who made a traditional dinner for the first time in an icy cold dorm. The guests were five other kids who couldn‚Äôt get home. That was in 1981. ‚ÄúI wish I could remember if we had the sense to be grateful then, for the food, for the comfort of one another, for the luxury of our education,‚Äù she wrote recently.

"Taming the corporate media beast The Crisis of the European Union Is Irreversible 
The political-economic block and its common currency cannot be salvaged Donate! The author is an Italian industrialist and honorary member of the Academy of Science of the Institut de France 
According to a well-known Italian Research Centre, from 2003 to 2014 the European single currency cost an 11% GDP reduction throughout the Eurozone and 18 million additional unemployed people. Conversely, as a result of the Maastricht agreement only, throughout the Eurozone we have lost 8 million jobs and an additional 5% of Gross Domestic Product, owing to the obligation to eliminate deficit and cut investment. Furthermore, the report of said Research Centre shows that, again in late 2014, the average EU unemployment rate was approximately 11.6%. In a scenario of parity with the dollar, the EU unemployment in the Eurozone would have been 5.8%, more or less the same as the US rate in that phase. Hence a monetary policy characterized by an excessive overvaluation of the European currency blocked both exports and the internal market at the same time. Furthermore, it created the conditions for a deterioration of public budgets in terms of deficit and debt. In fact, again at the end of 2014, the Eurozone recorded a public deficit totalling 269 billions which, without the single currency, would even be turned into a surplus of 165 billion euro, with a difference equal to 445 billions. In terms of GDP percentage, the difference would be 4.1 points while, with specific reference to the Eurozone‚Äôs public debt, we would have had three trillion euro less. Only for Italy, as many as 400 billion public debt less. Working on this assumption, all current evils would have been avoided if there had not been the overvaluation of the euro against the dollar. There would have not been the massive impact of the financial crisis coming from the United States, at first with Lehman Brothers‚Äô bankruptcy on September 15, 2008 and later with the recurrent banking crises in Europe, which put a strain on the public finances of major European governments. Considering that all EU governments were accustomed to borrow huge sums directly from the banking system, we can imagine the effects of the financial and credit crisis on the various European countries‚Äô budgets. It is worth recalling that the United States have never liked the euro ‚Äì quite the reverse they have always considered it ""imaginative and useless"", as former President George Bush I stated in recently-published public papers. Reading between the lines of its official documents, the EU itself maintains that the financial crisis came from the United States and that it made serious mistakes. Also according to the EU official documents, the mistakes were allegedly the following: 1) too much attention focused on the public budget deficit on an yearly basis, without being too much worried about the public debt as a whole. According to European standards, the EU government submitted reduced annual budgets for obtaining EU funding - later obviously the public debt increased anyway and real trouble came. Also thanks to the EU operating logic, the naive myth that the crisis was not structural and could be managed with some cosmetic measures has led to the current decline. Said decline has been triggered off by the rapid growth of interest rates on the EU Southern countries‚Äô public debt. 2) Again according to the EU papers, there has also been a lack of surveillance over competitiveness and macroeconomic imbalances. This is not great news. However, there is always someone who benefits from the economic disharmonies ‚Äì just to use the old terminology of the remarkable Italian philosopher Mario Calderoni - while others stand to lose as a result of them. There has never been a solidarity-based Europe during crises, but only in ""good times"". Therefore, in the losing countries, we recorded growing indebtedness of the private sector, not controlled owing to the myth of companies‚Äô autonomy - and hence an increasing weakening of banks. The other EU ""winning"" countries took over the losers‚Äô market shares. Again, instead of imposing draconian penalties which worsen the economic problems, we should have supported the weakest economies and the most unbalanced ones in terms of trade with the United States. The United States exported their mass of bad loans, disguised as new securities, to the European Union, the financial enemy that had dreamt of relegating the dollar to the rank of a Euro ancillary currency. There was also this geopolitical war within the crisis of the European currency. Moreover, the European Central Bank aimed at maintaining financial stability but, by statute, it could not buy public debt from other non-EU countries, as all issuing banks do. This is the main way in which central banks can nip in the bud speculative attempts against them. Furthermore, in Italy, as in other South Europe‚Äôs economies, foreign competition has kept wages at very low levels and, in dealing with competition for exports, our political and economic structure has only reduced the labour incomes almost to the level of the worst competitor. 3) Another EU public self-criticism is relating to the slow decision-making mechanism: the European establishment has interpreted the small shocks of the global crisis as isolated phenomena and not as a common geoeconomic problem. Hence the slow pace and often the ineffectiveness of the EU ""solutions"". And this faced with a ""market"" - if we may call it so - of investors who, as soon as they saw the crisis in the South, played a downward game or went away quickly. Good old days when the Treasury rightly bought the unsold debt securities at the Bank of Italy‚Äôs auctions. And, it is worth noting that, in so doing, it did not create inflation at all. Currently, however, markets are fast like jackals, which smell corpses, while States have been slow as marmots. This is the real problem of today‚Äôs politicians. States must increase their pace and be very quick and capable of understanding both adverse media and the political and military operations which are objectively dangerous for them. Moreover considering that, at the time, the public debt securities were held mostly by banks, their default was possible and easy to take place. Today there is a new crisis looming large on Europe, namely the crisis of non-performing loans: in Portugal, Italy and Spain, but also in some North European countries, the non-performing loans are worth over 540 billion euro. Hence shortly another European debt crisis will materialize. 4) Currently the European Union is basically a Gaullist-style ""Europe of States""‚Äì even though it strongly denies so. Hence the idea of ‚Äãcreating the ""United States of Europe"" is extraordinary nonsense: the EU Member States are so different from one another, and with such a diversified economy, that these ""United States of Europe"" would create more contrasts internally than externally, namely with the United States of America, Russia and China. Not to mention that, with a view to becoming today‚Äôs USA, America had to undergo a wide civil war, whose echoes are not completely over even today. 5) Moreover, the united Europe - and I am talking about the Euro zone - will be increasingly entangled in an area of ‚Äã‚Äãstructural deflation which condemns 'Italy, together with other less economically strong countries, to face an indefinite period of very low growth rates. On the contrary, the other North European countries will continue to grow and, above all, will not have to tackle the same problems we have, namely low wages and exports facing fierce competition, not protected by the Euro. 6) Hence what can be done? We must prepare for a slow but safe exit from the Euro, not waiting for the EU ""bureaucratic Caesarism"", as well as redefining and protecting our export area. Then we must use our credit instruments and debt securities as alternative currency, where possible ‚Äì as well as use some well-disguised protectionism also vis-√†-vis the EU itself. Finally, we must rethink our overall strategy, which we have never done. The economic crises are always geopolitical crises. Furthermore we must fund the companies‚Äô technological upgrade projects with State funds, without waiting for the EU claims. Last but not least, we must put an end to young people‚Äôs ""brain drain"". It is true that, as some liberal-masochists maintain, the current professions‚Äô market is global, but it is also true that the cost of their education and training has been borne by our State and our families.

"in: Special Interests , US News The new year is almost here and it‚Äôs often a time when we all start to think about what we want to change for the next year. I‚Äôve never been much a fan of the whole cliche of changing because of the new year, but why not embrace it as a time where we can make change? Do a quick reflection right now. Do you feel like you have followed your dreams and passions this past year? Do you feel you got caught up in the stresses of life quite often? Did you feel judgement, negative self talk and anger were a big part of your days? Reflecting on how you‚Äôve felt over your year and being honest with yourself about it gives you the chance to know how to adjust and move forward from this moment forward whether it be the new year or not. I‚Äôve found in my own life that if I don‚Äôt pay attention to how I feel, what I create, what‚Äôs playing out in my life and take responsibility for it, it doesn‚Äôt change. It stays the same, I experience the same emotions or stagnant feelings, and I don‚Äôt move forward. But the moment I decide to take it into my own hands, I see how much I‚Äôm not a victim to what happens. 11 Things To Let Go of Before the New year 1. Stop all the negative self talk ‚Äì It‚Äôs first because it‚Äôs probably one of the most important. The more we talk poorly about ourselves to ourselves or others, the more we disempower ourselves and empower all the things we wish to adjust about ourselves. Observe it, take note of it, and kick it. It‚Äôs not helping you. 2. Choose one bad eating habit and kick it! ‚Äì Taking care of and fuelling your vessel is one of the most important things we can do in life to stay mentally, emotionally and spiritually healthy. Pick one of your worst eating habits and aim to cut it out completely in 3 months. Whatever it might be, be honest with yourself and make it happen. Then take on the next bad eating habit in 3 months. 3. Let go of chasing ‚Äòsuccess‚Äô ‚Äì So often we put up goals or plans for ourselves yet have this tiny limited scope of what success is. Next thing you know we bring stress, worry and fear into the equation throughout the whole journey because we may not be totally in line to hit this pin prick point of what success looks like to us. Instead, do your best to take the steps needed to get to where you want to go, but let go of the lure of success and what it looks like and means. There‚Äôs no such thing as failure. (more) 4. Kick the idea that you cannot achieve or follow your dreams ‚Äì So often we have our ideas of what we are excited or passionate about, but let it go because we think we can‚Äôt do it or because it‚Äôs unrealistic. Instead of believing every word of that, take ONE step. One step towards making your passion or your dreams happen. The one step will lead to the next and the next, but you have to take the first one. Plan out that first step and take it! 5. Let go of the idea that you should run from your problems ‚Äì We often get into this mentality that we just need to ‚Äúget over it.‚Äù In theory this sounds sorta good, you move on from things that happen in the past or something to that effect. But by just forgetting about it, did we really move on? No, it gets triggered again later or lies dormant as a resented event etc. Instead, let‚Äôs face our problems and truly move past them. Journal about it, talk to someone else about it. Put the cards on the table to someone who cares about you and who can help you move past it. Pick someone who will see the bigger picture and be honest with you. You have all it takes to move past what challenges you. 6. Stop comparing yourself to others ‚Äì This is a big one. So often we are looking at others and using what they have, do or are to compare it against us and make up a story. This whole game can make us sad or feel down about ourselves or it can feed our ego in a big way. Let it go, respect everyone‚Äôs journey, including your own and stop the need to compare yourself to others. 7. Stop judging others ‚Äì Judging other people can become a habit and an addiction. It‚Äôs like something we can‚Äôt stop doing sometimes! Take a moment the next time you judge someone and observe it. Ask yourself why you did it, how did it make you feel? Etc. Make a conscious effort to stop. (more) 8. Stop the blame game ‚Äì Blaming and pointing fingers when it comes to our challenges or what happens to us doesn‚Äôt allow us to look at and observe how we might have created or aligned with an experience to help make it happen. I‚Äôm not saying there‚Äôs no such things others can do to hurt you, I‚Äôm simply saying take responsibility for how you feel and don‚Äôt even point blame, it doesn‚Äôt help us. 9. Stop worrying and trying so hard to fit in and be accepted ‚Äì This is something far too many of us do just to save face and not be ‚Äúthe weird one.‚Äù The reality is, it‚Äôs more ‚Äòweird‚Äô to be a version of yourself that isn‚Äôt genuine or real simply because you want to be accepted by others. It‚Äôs a choice you can‚Äôt maintain forever and the longer it goes the more uncomfortable you will feel. Be you, accept yourself, be genuine and don‚Äôt try to make others do the same when. Let it happen. Trust. 10. Let go of the need to control everything ‚Äì Sometimes we can‚Äôt take a step forward in anything because we don‚Äôt know all the answers or all the variables. This is our obsession with control sometimes. Yes, observe a situation and make the best choices available to you, but don‚Äôt worry so much about needing to control or know every detail about it. Learn to leave things up to trust and knowing that things will work out as they need to. This doesn‚Äôt mean be reckless, just that you don‚Äôt need to control every thing, person and detail. 11. Stop procrastinating ‚Äì This one goes with everything on the list. Stop putting it all off. Whatever it may be. The changes listed above, the hobby you want to, the career you want to explore, or the thing you want to tell to someone important to you. Stop putting it off and just do it!

Last Saturday, Oct. 29, the Medford Police Patrolmen‚Äôs Association (MPPA) of Medford, Massachusetts, posted 3 photos on its Facebook page of two Medford police officers seemingly arresting a person in a Hillary Clinton mask and orange prison clothes at the Halloween Fall Festival in Haines Square, West Medford. 
CBS Boston reports, Oct. 30, 2016, that the caption on the photos read: 
‚ÄúLook who MPD grabbed at the Fall Festival in Haines Square today‚Ä¶‚Äù 
Another photo showed three Medford police officers posing with someone in a Donald Trump mask, with the caption, ‚ÄúMaking America GREAT again in West Medford Square!!‚Äù 
By 8:15 pm that night, MPPA removed the posts from its Facebook page, with an apology in a statement from MPPA President Harry MacGilvray: 
‚ÄúThese were Halloween costumes. It was meant totally as a joke. I apologize if this offended anyone in any way. I never expected this sort of reaction. It was poor judgment on my part.‚Äù 
MacGilvray was one of the officers in the photos. LOL 
Fox25 WFXT reports that the police union removed the photos because of a flurry of negative Facebook comments from Hillary supporters, such as: 
Jennifer Popkin: ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt believe this unprofessional behavior. Police in uniform should not be espousing political beliefs, let alone the kind of irresponsible rhetoric coming from Donald Trump. Absolutely deplorable and also likely illegal under Section 23(b)(2)(ii) of the conflict of interest law.‚Äù 
Mike Piehl: ‚ÄúTrump goes on trial for fraud in November and child rape in December but YOU . . . .‚Äù 
Jeremy Thorpe: ‚ÄúThis is illegal. I am screen-shotting this comment to demonstrate that you are deleting critical comments.‚Äù 
Katarina Dutton: ‚ÄúAs a citizen of Medford, I am appalled by police making it clear that I, and so many others, are not welcome or safe here.‚Äù 
Tamar Amidon: ‚ÄúThis is so shameful for Medford. I‚Äôm so glad I don‚Äôt live there now. I never thought of them being one of the bad apple bins.‚Äù 
That Popkin, Piehl, Thorpe, Dutton, Amidon, et al. are outraged by the Medford police Halloween prank but not in the least bothered by of Hillary Clinton‚Äôs criminal use of an unsecured email server, her utterly corrupt pay-for-play Clinton Foundation, and her abandoning four Americans to die in Benghazi, can only mean one thing:

"Posted on November 6, 2016 by Eric Zuesse. Eric Zuesse The leading financiers of the Republican Party, the Koch brothers, were exposed on November 4th by the great investigative journalist Lee Fang, as being solid supporters and heavy financiers of congressional candidates who have been leaders in expanding the U.S. military budget and moving America toward a police state (including militarization of the police). The leading financier of the Democratic Party, George Soros, has long been known to provide major financial backing for the most-neoconservative Democratic candidates, such as Hillary Clinton, who favor every possible military invasion and coup (and see this , for more on that). In fact, Soros was one of the top three financial backers (the other two were the U.S. government and the Netherlands government) for the television station in Ukraine that championed extermination of the people in Ukraine‚Äôs Donbass region, where the coup-imposed government, which he helped to install, is loathed . And also on the Ukrainian matter, the Kochs have championed the view that when considering whether Crimea should be part of Russia, or else part of Ukraine, or else entirely independent, the people who live there shouldn‚Äôt have any opportunity to vote on the matter, and they should instead be forced to be ‚ÄòUkrainians‚Äô , even if they loathe this post-coup Ukrainian governmen t. Soros and the Kochs insist that this Ukrainian government should be imposed upon Crimeans, regardless of what they want. In fact, Soros has proposed adding from 20 to 50 billion taxpayer dollars to the effort by the coup-imposed Ukrainian government‚Äôs military, in order for that government to achieve this conquest of Crimea (to restore it to Ukraine, to which it had been forcibly joined, by the Soviet dictator Khrushchev in 1954, after having been for hundreds of years a part of Russia ‚Äî and to which Obama and the Kochs and Soros insist it belongs). Regarding the U.S. Presidential contest, the difference between the Kochs and Soros is that the Kochs in 2016 directed all of their political financing away from the Presidential contest altogether, so as to weaken Trump‚Äôs effort to beat Hillary, whereas Soros has devoted tens of millions of dollars to the financing of Hillary‚Äôs campaign and of PACS (such as this) that support Hillary against Trump. Hillary is supported by Kochs and the big oil-and-gas firms as well as by Soros and Wall Street. Virtually all of the U.S. aristocracy want Hillary Clinton to become President. Right after the nominating conventions, the Kochs withdrew their financial backing of the Republican ‚Äòhawk‚Äô U.S. Senatorial candidate Ron Johnson in Wisconsin because Johnson had just endorsed Trump . But afterwards, the Kochs ‚Äî as Lee Fang noted ‚Äî spent big on the campaigns of Ron Johnson and of other pro-Lockheed-Martin (etc.) Senators. To be pro ‚ÄòDefense‚Äô industry, isn‚Äôt to be pro-U.S. defense, but instead to be pro-mega-corporate investors, and that‚Äôs something America‚Äôs entire aristocracy are, because they control all of the large U.S.-based corporations. Those corporations expand by the U.S. military having the might to enforce in foreign countries what their owners want ‚Äî so that America‚Äôs State Department and USAID etc. can serve as spokespersons for, essentially, the billionaires who own controlling blocs of stock in U.S.-based international corporations. That‚Äôs ‚Äúthe system,‚Äù which Hillary Clinton and the Kochs and Soros and all the rest of the U.S. aristocracy support, and which Bernie Sanders opposed without understanding it. If Donald Trump understands it, he‚Äôs been keeping that fact secret from his followers, who generally understand nothing of it at all. Maybe if he were to try to explain it to them he‚Äôd be called ‚Äòunpatriotic‚Äô ‚Äî even though his trying to explain it to them would actually be the deepest form of patriotism. Unfortunately, for him to be patriotic in that way would probably be politically suicidal for his campaign. He instead points to ‚Äúforeigners‚Äù as being America‚Äôs enemies, when the real enemies are actually right at home in America ‚Äî and they‚Äôre enemies of the entire world, not just their own country. These are the people at the top of the global food-chain. It‚Äôs not clear whether Trump feels mainly that he‚Äôs one of them, or instead that they‚Äôre his chief enemies. How much more ambiguous could a person be than that? And is the ambiguity intentional? The most reliable answer might be found by identifying whom his actual political enemies are ‚Äî and they seem to be virtually all of the global aristocracy. Maybe they know him in ways that the U.S. public don‚Äôt and can‚Äôt. The public will just have to guess. But no guesses are necessary in order to understand Hillary Clinton. She has a lengthy record in public office, and it‚Äôs entirely consistent, as a neoconservative .",Foregin,
"WASHINGTON  ‚Äî     Donald J. Trump is broadening the field of candidates for secretary of state as his transition team remains divided nearly a month after the election over how to fill the most prominent gap in his prospective cabinet. Kellyanne Conway, a top adviser to Mr. Trump, told reporters on Sunday that the search had expanded beyond the four men thought to be under consideration and that Mr. Trump planned to interview additional candidates early this week. Those new candidates appeared to include John R. Bolton, an ambassador to the United Nations under President George W. Bush Jon M. Huntsman Jr. the former Utah governor and ambassador to China under President Obama Rex W. Tillerson, the president and chief executive of Exxon Mobil and Senator Joe Manchin III, Democrat of West Virginia. Asked about the search on the ABC program ‚ÄúThis Week,‚Äù Vice   Mike Pence mentioned Mr. Bolton as a potential candidate and said others could be added to the list. Mr. Bolton met with Mr. Trump for about an hour on Friday, and Mr. Tillerson is set to meet with Mr. Trump on Tuesday, according to two people briefed on the meetings. Despite their differences over the Iraq war, which Mr. Bolton ardently supported, Mr. Trump said during the campaign that he turned to Mr. Bolton for military advice and called him ‚Äúa tough cookie. ‚Äù The transition team had previously signaled that the group under consideration had narrowed to four men: Mitt Romney, the 2012 Republican presidential nominee Rudolph W. Giuliani, the former mayor of New York and a close ally of Mr. Trump Senator Bob Corker of Tennessee, the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee and David H. Petraeus, the retired general and director of the C. I. A. under President Obama. Some of those candidates may be brought back in for further interviews, the people briefed on the meetings said. An announcement of a selection for the post is not expected for at least several more days. In an audition of sorts, Mr. Petraeus appeared on ‚ÄúThis Week‚Äù to highlight his foreign policy experience in the military and his work abroad in the private sector. He also sought to put behind him a potentially significant hurdle to his candidacy: his mishandling of classified material while he was a top general. He pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor charge in 2015 and was forced to resign as C. I. A. director. ‚ÄúFive years ago, I made a serious mistake,‚Äù Mr. Petraeus said. ‚ÄúI acknowledged it. I apologized for it. I paid a very heavy price for it, and I‚Äôve learned from it. ‚Äù But he added that it was up to others to ‚Äúdetermine whether that is indeed disqualifying or not. ‚Äù The wrangling over who should be America‚Äôs top diplomat comes as Mr. Trump‚Äôs team continues to face questions about his   phone conversation with the president of Taiwan last week, which angered China and rattled other Asian nations. Mr. Bolton advocates closer ties with Taiwan as a means of putting pressure on China, arguing that Beijing‚Äôs growing power in the region should be checked. Mr. Trump‚Äôs advisers are battling, at times publicly, over whether he should choose from among his campaign loyalists or go outside that circle, a move that could alienate voters who were angry at the Republican establishment. Much of that wrangling has centered on Mr. Romney, who was among Mr. Trump‚Äôs fiercest critics during the campaign. Mr. Trump has told aides that he believes that Mr. Romney would ‚Äúlook the part‚Äù as the face of American outreach to the world and would make a fine secretary of state. But Ms. Conway, who has been openly critical of Mr. Romney, continued to attack him during a ‚ÄúFox News Sunday‚Äù appearance, saying that the backlash to his candidacy among Mr. Trump‚Äôs core supporters had been ‚Äúbreathtaking. ‚Äù Asked if her criticism of him was appropriate, she said, ‚ÄúI would turn the question around and ask, was it appropriate for Governor Romney to stick his neck out so far in attacking Donald Trump, and never walking it back, never encouraging people to support the nominee once Mr. Trump had won the nomination squarely and fairly. ‚Äù Ms. Conway, answering questions from reporters about the expanded search as she entered Trump Tower in New York on Sunday, said the transition team had been happily surprised by the number of wealthy businesspeople who had come forward to express interest. Mr. Trump, who was lifted to victory in the election in large part by the support of white   voters, has faced criticism over his appointment of several   people to top posts. ‚ÄúThere are a number of people that we may not have thought wanted to leave their very lucrative private industry positions to go and serve the government,‚Äù Ms. Conway said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs exciting, frankly, to at least get their counsel. ‚Äù Another person who will meet this week with Mr. Trump is James G. Stavridis, a retired admiral whose name was floated as a potential running mate for Hillary Clinton. It was unclear if he was being considered for a specific position. Despite the very public    over the secretary of state appointment, Mr. Trump remains well ahead of the pace set by most of his predecessors in naming members of his cabinet. In addition to meetings this week, he is scheduled to travel at least twice, to Fayetteville, N. C. and to Des Moines, on his ‚Äúthank you‚Äù tour. Mr. Petraeus spoke on the ABC program from the sideline of a conference in Germany, greeting the host, George Stephanopoulos, with a ‚Äúguten tag‚Äù before beginning the interview. The retired general praised Mr. Trump as ‚Äúactually quite pragmatic. ‚Äù He appeared careful not to contradict Mr. Trump on a range of his foreign policy priorities, including building a border wall between the United States and Mexico, potentially working with Russia to defeat the Islamic State, and discarding the Iran nuclear accord. ‚ÄúIn our conversation, what I enjoyed, most frankly, was the discussion of issues, or, say, campaign rhetoric, if you will, and then placing that in a strategic context,‚Äù Mr. Petraeus said. Before he appeared on the show, Mr. Petraeus seemed to get a lift from Mr. Pence, who dismissed concerns about Mr. Petraeus‚Äôs mishandling of classified material, in which he gave secret materials to a biographer with whom he was having an affair. Mr. Pence called Mr. Petraeus an ‚ÄúAmerican hero‚Äù and said Mr. Trump would consider him based on ‚Äúthe totality‚Äù of his career. ‚ÄúLook, he made mistakes, and he paid the consequences for those mistakes,‚Äù Mr. Pence said.",Foregin,

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs going to be you,‚Äù the Academy of Excellence teacher allegedly warned a 12-year-old Muslim student after showing the class a movie about the 9/11 attacks. And if that sounds outrageous, brace yourself because it gets a lot worse. 
No wonder the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) and the ACLU of Arizona are siccing the U.S. Dept. of Justice and the U.S. Dept. of Education on this travesty of a public charter school and this shameful example of an educator‚Äôs sorry a**. Heather Weaver from the ACLU‚Äôs national office reports they‚Äôve filed formal complaints on behalf of the Muslim student and his family. 
Asli Noor and her five children are refugees who settled in Phoenix, Arizona after fleeing Somalia. Like most parents, she wants opportunities and a good education for her children. And for many families ‚Äî especially those living in low-income neighborhoods ‚Äî that means a public charter school like the sadly misnamed ‚ÄúExcellence Academy.‚Äù 
The boy and his eight-year-old sister (referred to in the complaint as A.A. and F.A.) had started the 2015-2016 school year when the family‚Äôs new set of troubles began. 
According to the complaints, an ‚ÄúAcademy of Excellence‚Äù teacher named Faye Myles began ‚Äúsingling out‚Äù the then 11-year-old, sixth grade Muslim student as the 2015-16 school year began for ‚Äúdisfavorable treatment because of his faith and nationality.‚Äù 
‚ÄòAnother time, when A.A. raised his hand to answer a question, his teacher snapped at him‚Ää‚Äî‚Ää‚ÄúAll you Muslims think you are so smart‚Äù‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääin front of the entire class.‚Äô 
Oh, and then the boy recalls the math and science teacher for grades 5-8 digressing into a special kind of lesson in civics and current events. 
‚ÄòI can‚Äôt wait until Trump is elected. He‚Äôs going to deport all you Muslims. Muslims shouldn‚Äôt be given visas. They‚Äôll probably take away your visa and deport you. You‚Äôre going to be the next terrorist, I bet.‚Äô 
Faye Myles also allegedly found other ways to wound her young Muslim student with her bigotry. She repeatedly denied him the right to pray during recess, which is hard to imagine ever happening to a Christian student. The child also claims his ‚ÄúAcademy of Excellence‚Äù teacher would also would tell him to ‚Äúshut up‚Äù and punish him during class ‚Äúdowntime‚Äù when the other students were allowed to talk with each other. 
The bus rides home added to the child‚Äôs misery as his classmates began to follow the teacher‚Äôs example and pile on the insults. 
‚ÄòOn the bus ride home, A.A.‚Äôs classmates took up his teacher‚Äôs anti-Muslim, anti-immigrant crusade, taunting him about the fact that his visa would be revoked because he is a Muslim, calling him a ‚Äúterrorist,‚Äù and accusing him of planning to blow up the bus.‚Äô 
The child, of course, started feeling anxious and physically ill ‚Äúwith a stomach ache‚Äù and had no desire to return to the ‚ÄúAcademy of Excellence.‚Äù 
In January, Asli Noor met with school officials to complain about these incidents. Three days later, the school asked her to pick her son up early because he had supposedly tried to open the school bus‚Äô emergency window. Noor demanded they verify these accusations with footage from the security camera but school officials refused. 
And then Brenda Nelson, an ‚ÄúAcademy of Excellence‚Äù board member, printed out two ‚Äúvoluntary‚Äù withdrawal forms for A.A. and his younger sister F.A. She then allegedly ordered Ms. Noor to sign them, saying: 
‚ÄòGet your kids out of here. I don‚Äôt want them here.‚Äô 
When Asri Noor begged for time to find another school for her children, Brenda Nelson callously refused. 
Unfortunately, these incidents of anti-Muslim bigotry in publicly-funded schools are happening more frequently. Think Progress reports that even in schools where teachers try to fight it, Trump-inspired bullying is a serious issue. 
‚ÄòIn spite of some teachers‚Äô valiant efforts to teach students about Trump, it would appear that schoolchildren already invoke the candidate‚Äôs name to scare their Latino and Muslim classmates, referencing the candidate‚Äôs harsh claims of Latino criminals and Muslim terrorists.‚Äô 
And, sadly, it‚Äôs not just the kids. 
‚ÄòA predominantly Latino elementary school in California was graffiti-tagged with the words ‚ÄúBuild the wall higher‚Äù last week, alluding to Trump‚Äôs policy plan to build a southern U.S. border wall to keep out undocumented immigrants.‚Äô 
And in case you assume the ‚ÄúAcademy of Excellence‚Äù teacher is one of those mean white Trump supporters, you‚Äôre wrong. Apparently, she‚Äôs a mean black Trump supporter. @KhaledBeydoun The teacher works at Academy of Excellence & her name is Faye Myles per the article. She should be called out. pic.twitter.com/BbL3YdzEG8

"It is all about the price. Millions of people buying insurance in the marketplaces created by the federal health care law have one feature in mind. It is not finding a favorite doctor, or even a trusted company. It is how much  ‚Äî   or, more precisely, how little  ‚Äî   they can pay in premiums each month. And for many of them, especially those who are healthy, all the prices are too high. The unexpected laser focus on price has contributed to hundreds of millions of dollars in losses among the country‚Äôs top insurers, as fewer healthy people than expected have signed up. And that has created two vexing questions: Will the major insurance companies stay in the marketplaces? And if they do, will the public have a wide array of plans to choose from  ‚Äî   a central tenet of the 2010 Affordable Care Act? ‚ÄúThe marketplace has been and continues to be unsustainable,‚Äù said Joseph R. Swedish, chief executive of Anthem, one of the nation‚Äôs largest insurers. Most Americans with health insurance get it through their employers or from government programs like Medicare and Medicaid. The marketplaces were created under the health care law to give the millions of people not covered in those ways a way to buy health plans. While major insurers continue to make profits over all, they say that the economics of the marketplaces do not work for them. Insurers can offer marketplace plans at four different coverage tiers, and the government subsidizes the premiums for millions of people. The thinking was that enough healthy people would buy insurance to balance out the costs for the   . But things are not going exactly as envisioned. People shopping in the marketplaces are overwhelmingly choosing the cheapest plans they can find, according to a federal analysis. In 2014,   of people went for the   or    plans in each of the tiers. In 2015, about half chose the cheapest plans. The pricing pressure is playing out on multiple fronts. People with expensive medical conditions, knowing that they need reliable coverage, seem willing to pay a little more for plans offered by the large companies. Those plans tend to have a wider choice of doctors and a stronger brand name, and the insurers say the people signing up are sicker than they expected. Healthy and young people  ‚Äî   who are essential to insurers to offset the costs of care for unhealthy people  ‚Äî   are regularly turning to whatever plan is cheapest, including those from   insurers or with the smallest networks of hospitals and doctors. Many other young and healthy people, particularly those not eligible for generous subsidies, are shunning plans altogether, finding all of the prices too high. That decision puts them at risk of tax penalties. By some estimates, about 10 million people are signed up, fewer than half of the 21 million expected by now. All of this has the major insurance companies, as they finish their third year of selling individual policies under the law, reevaluating their role in the marketplace. The top insurers have essentially stopped talking about expanding their marketplace ambitions. Two companies, UnitedHealth Group and Humana, have said they plan to largely exit the marketplaces. Aetna has halted plans to enter more states. Even insurers that insist they are committed, like Anthem, which offers   Blue Cross plans in more than a dozen states, are struggling to find their way. Mr. Swedish describes the market as ‚Äúnot predictable and not reliable. ‚Äù If the major insurers keep cutting back, it could lead to a cascade of effects for the people who depend on the marketplaces for coverage. People could potentially face higher premiums because there are fewer insurers competing, and they could have more limited choices of plans and doctors. The apprehension is not lost on regulators and lawmakers. On Thursday, the Obama administration said it was exploring ways to protect insurers from very expensive medical claims. And recently in The Journal of the American Medical Association, President Obama wrote that more financial assistance for people may be needed. So the mainstream insurers are struggling to find a business model for the marketplaces that works. If an insurer is successful at being the cheapest in a market, it has often found that it priced its plans too low to cover its medical costs. Some smaller insurers have already gone out of business. But if an insurer prices a plan too high, it might not attract enough healthy people to break even. Companies both large and small now plan to raise prices sharply for 2017, which could prevent even more people from buying policies. ‚ÄúThe price competition has turned out to be much more cutthroat than anyone expected,‚Äù said Larry Levitt, an executive with the Kaiser Family Foundation, which closely tracks the law. Still, most experts say there is no immediate danger that the market will collapse. Marjorie Connolly, a spokeswoman for the Department of Health and Human Services, said in a statement that the Obama administration was confident that the marketplaces would ‚Äúcontinue to thrive for years ahead. ‚Äù The department said on Thursday that the people entering the marketplaces are becoming more mixed over time, and the marketplaces are attracting more young and healthy people over all. The major insurers, though, say the healthy people are going to other plans, often the least expensive ones offered by their smaller competitors. Some defenders of the law say it is working as intended, harnessing competition to keep premiums as low as possible. ‚ÄúWe have to be realistic,‚Äù said Linda J. Blumberg, a health care expert at the Urban Institute, noting that some large companies may not be nimble enough to succeed. ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt lower costs without breaking some eggs. ‚Äù Not every insurance company is struggling. The exceptions seem to be those that offer the most limited choice of doctors and hospitals and may pay them the least, including plans offered by companies like Molina and Centene, which previously specialized in covering   Medicaid patients. The insurers faring the worst sell plans that resemble those traditionally offered through employers. The plans give customers much greater latitude over where to get care and cover some of the   doctors and   hospitals. The trouble is that people signing up for those plans are less healthy  ‚Äî   and more expensive to treat  ‚Äî   than anticipated. The companies also say that the provisions of the law aimed at stabilizing the market and protecting them from heavy losses are not working. Several say that consolidation is the answer. Anthem, for example, says the only way it can expand in the marketplaces is by merging with Cigna, a deal the Justice Department is trying to block. Another remedy is to attract a broader range of customers. ‚ÄúWe have to get a healthier pool of people in the market,‚Äù said Kurt Kossen, an executive at Health Care Service Corporation, which operates nonprofit Blue Cross plans in several states but lost $1. 5 billion last year. The result could be a market essentially left to insurers that offer the same narrow networks found in Medicaid plans and some remaining Blue Cross plans, said Mr. Levitt, of the Kaiser Family Foundation. ‚ÄúThe market is sustainable but with a different mix of plans,‚Äù he said.",Foregin,

Hafnarfjor√∞ur, Iceland. 
The votes are in. In a greater-than-expected 79% turnout, election results show that Iceland‚Äôs Pirate Party has not come out in first place as earlier polls indicated might be the case. They have, however, increased their size in the Parliament 3-fold (from 3 seats to 10) but this will not be enough to steer Iceland in their direction. 
Now it¬¥s all about coalition building. 
Had they maintained those poll numbers from earlier this summer (at a one-time high of 35%), that would have given them the probable first choice to form a coalition government with either the Left-Greens, the Social-Democrats, or the center-leftish Bright Future. As it stands now, they will need to band together, something they all they agreed to consider during a pre-election press conference. 
The largest single party remains the corporate-right Independence Party with 29% or 21 seats and which is now part of the governing coalition along with the center-right Progressive Party (who suffered a humiliating loss of 11 seats, now down to 8). This coalition is the same center-right configuration which led Iceland to financial disaster, the flight of skilled doctors and other professionals, and whose members were implicated in off-shore money scams which led to the resignation earlier this year of their last PM from the Progressive Party, causing these early elections, and now to the formal resignation of their present PM just a few hours ago. Technically these two parties could form a 3-party coalition along with the new Regeneration Party. However, Regeneration leader Benedikt J√≥hanesson has said he wouldn¬¥t consider a coalition with the governing parties. Thus that particular scenario is doubted. 
After years of political stagnation following the collapse of the economy, and controversy over the Panama Papers leaking of wealthy Icelanders¬¥ involvement in Tortola, this new development reflects a growing, widespread disgust at the traditional two party coalition rulers who have alternately or in pairs run the country for most of its years following Iceland‚Äôs independence. 
The ship is floundering and the present course is unsustainable. 
The other numbers however, are pointing to a change of course: The Pirates won 14.5% giving them 10 seats in the 63 seat Parliament, the Althing. The Left-Greens received 15.9% (for 10 Seats); the Social Democrats 5.7% (3 seats) and Bright Future 7.2% (winning 4 seats).Together they represent almost 30% of the electorate. These are the groups which began talking about joining forces this past week, just before the election. 
If a four party coalition is solidified, then Iceland becomes the second nation to have a viable Pirate Party within its government (Germany is the first) and the first to have it this close to the helm in the country¬¥s governance. 
The kingmakers could very well be Regeneration, a new, center-right grouping who won 10.5% of the votes getting them 7 seats. They characterize themselves as ‚Äúliberal‚Äù, though the head was a long-time supporter of the Independence Party before leaving this past year. On the 18th of October he said he wouldn‚Äôt consider joining a coalition with the two-headed ruling hydra of the Independence and Progressive parties. Were he instead to agree to an alliance with the four roughly left, center-left groups of which the Pirates are a part (something he declared he was open to the morning after the election), then that would net a total of 34 seats (27 + their 7) and a solid majority. A five party coalition. 
What does this all mean? It means several things: in the short run, the helm of the Icelandic political ship will remain loosely dominated by the Independence Party as the largest single grouping in the Althingi (Parliament). But aside from that approximately 30% of the electorate who aren¬¥t swayed by anything but their loyalty to the ruling class, the rest of the country is moving on. They are actively exploring hitherto unheard of politics (with the Pirates) and considering broad coalition politics (5 groups trying to control the direction of the country). This may be the wave of the future. Or it may simply be a transitional era where loyalties are split and serious discussions about radical ideas like ownership of public resources (and actually and clearly defining such) occur openly as the public coalesces around a new, dominant ideology. In the long run, things are changing. And then there is this issue of a new Constitution which was voted on and accepted by the public but which the ruling coalition simply ignored and shelved. If that was now formally accepted, then some serious changes may be in store for the Owners of the country. But today is only the day after, and nothing has been decided yet. 
So what¬¥s next? Well, the new President‚Äôs job just got more complicated as he is the one who traditionally asks the leading party to form the new government and, if they fail in securing a stable majority, the next leading party would get a shot. This was easier when the totals were generally in favor of one or the other of the two ruling groups. Now, however, a new multi-party dynamic is at play. Who knows how the discussions are heading right now, and which horses are being traded? 
Iceland has always been the most USAmerican of the Nordic countries but with tugs in both directions. Much like the island itself, rent down the middle by volcanic cracks dividing the European and American tectonic plates, these tugs are causing great tension as to which political direction the country should follow. With history having taken them this far and a growing unease about the dominant parties¬¥ corruption and rehashed free market rhetoric, it appears Iceland is not quite ready to jump ship and hand the wheel over to the Pirates. But they and their kind are looking better and better as each year passes and Iceland drifts without a clear direction to prosperity and fairness. In the long run, that tectonic split in politics is getting wider and wider, just like its geographical counterpart. 
But it is the Pirates who at least have captured the imagination of the people (and, in particular the young). If they can convince the rest of the public that they are more seriously interested in governing than in luring Edward Snowden here (a publicity stunt at best) and have more relevant meat and potato concerns beyond internet privacy, then they may very well be the ultimate winners a few years down the road.

"In a   conference room at Stanford University, a score of scholars, many of them eminent and some from as far away as Johannesburg and Beijing, gathered last month to compare philosophical notions of hierarchy and equality. The gathering itself had no overt hierarchy, though one participant seemed a little more equal than the others. When Nicolas Berggruen spoke, no one interrupted. Only he occasionally checked his phone. And at dinner, the guests received fruit tarts for dessert  ‚Äî   except for Mr. Berggruen, who was served chocolate mousse. Mr. Berggruen, 54, is an investor and art collector who was once known as the ‚Äúhomeless billionaire‚Äù because he lived in itinerant luxury in   hotels. Now he is grounded in Los Angeles where he presides over a bespoke think tank, the Berggruen Institute. The institute is a striking example of how wealthy philanthropists are reshaping the landscape with smaller versions of the foundations established by Bill Gates and George Soros. Sean Parker, one of the entrepreneurs behind Napster and Facebook, has a research institute, The Parker Foundation, which this month pledged $250 million for cancer immunotherapy. He is also a   of the Economic Innovation Group, which labels itself an ‚Äúideas laboratory. ‚Äù Tom Steyer, who made his fortune as a hedge fund manager in California, has several environmental nonprofit groups, and last year created the Fair Shake Commission to redress economic inequality. ‚ÄúThere is a generation of new donors who have huge assets, and their own ideas, and think traditional think tanks are ‚Äù said James G. McGann, the director of the Think Tanks and Civil Societies Program at the University of Pennsylvania  ‚Äî   a think tank that thinks about think tanks. In a   culture where tweets, not position papers, shape the national conversation, these kinds of   ‚Äúare likely to be more influential than we are,‚Äù Mr. McGann said. Mr. Berggruen stands out because he is a   but   player at the nexus of wealth and rumination who is also a bit mysterious  ‚Äî   a Gatsby who shows up at his own parties. ‚ÄúI am a person who likes to engage in learning,‚Äù Mr. Berggruen said, in an accent reflecting his Parisian upbringing and dual German and American citizenship. The next step was ‚Äúto see if I can produce some ideas,‚Äù he said. Mr. Berggruen‚Äôs investment company, Berggruen Holdings, is registered in the British Virgin Islands and his charitable trust is based in Bermuda. The institute bankrolls several conferences a year, and Mr. Berggruen attends almost every session, takes careful notes and sometimes even appears to dress the part. At a dinner for philosophy scholars at the Stanford Park Hotel in March, he wore a dark blazer and a crisp white shirt unbuttoned to his sternum, the signature look of the French celebrity philosopher   L√©vy. There are conflicting views about this kind of endeavor. ‚ÄúOne of the delights of philanthropy is that it isn‚Äôt programmed, it is scattershot, with so much room for idiosyncratic choices,‚Äù said Karl Zinsmeister, author of ‚ÄúThe Almanac of American Philanthropy. ‚Äù He cited the example of Daniel Guggenheim, who championed the rocketry pioneer Robert Goddard in the 1930s when he was widely dismissed as a crackpot. ‚ÄúOf course there is a high percentage of waste,‚Äù Mr. Zinsmeister said, ‚Äúbut that‚Äôs how discovery works. ‚Äù Others worry, though, that at least some of these initiatives are vanity projects. Mr. Berggruen‚Äôs institute ‚Äúseems like a   of his creation,‚Äù McGann said, referring to the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland  ‚Äî   the Ascot of conferences for the global elite. Mr. McGann publishes an annual report on the world‚Äôs top think tanks, ranking them in more than 50 categories. The Berggruen Institute is not included in any of them. Mr. Berggruen happens to be a Davos habitu√©, but his institute has a more eclectic mandate. Besides philosophy, he has spent time and money on efforts to reform the California budget. He has established councils to study European integration and China. The Berggruen Institute will award an annual $1 million prize in philosophy beginning this year. It is presently funding six Berggruen academic fellowships to China and other places, and it has selected 16 others for the   academic year. Mr. Berggruen says he bought more than 400 acres in Brentwood, Calif. and has commissioned the renowned Swiss architecture firm Herzog  de Meuron to design his institute‚Äôs headquarters. Craig Calhoun, who is leaving the directorship of the London School of Economics this summer, was appointed president. Mr. Calhoun said his mandate was to ‚Äúdeepen the conversation. ‚Äù Mr. Berggruen has a gift for networking. ‚ÄúHe knows everyone,‚Äù said his friend Stefan Simchowitz, an art dealer. At the philosophy conference in Stanford, he hosted a conversation about artificial intelligence with Antonio Damasio, a neuroscientist who heads the Brain and Creativity Institute at the University of Southern California, and Reid Hoffman, a   of LinkedIn. Mr. Hoffman met Mr. Berggruen through a mutual friend who mentioned Mr. Berggruen‚Äôs interests in California governance and Chinese philosophy. ‚ÄúI said, ‚ÄòYeah, that‚Äôs interesting. Let me meet him,‚Äô‚Äù Mr. Hoffman recalled. The luminaries listed on the institute‚Äôs advisory boards are the kind who pop up at White House state dinners or on Barry Diller‚Äôs yacht: Arianna Huffington,   of The Huffington Post the SpaceX founder Elon Musk Tony Blair, the former British prime minister Francis Fukuyama, the Stanford professor and former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not really involved anymore, but I like Nicolas,‚Äù Ms. Rice said in a phone interview. She served on the Think Long Committee for California, a brain trust Mr. Berggruen assembled in 2010 to address the state‚Äôs budget crisis. Mr. Berggruen makes it easy for even very busy people to lend their prestige. He foots the bills, booking guests in luxury hotels and sometimes ferrying them on his private jet. In workshops, he asks the kind of   questions that politicians, intellectuals and billionaires like to answer. Last November, Mr. Berggruen convened former prime ministers and other eminences in Beijing to discuss the future of China. Upon the group‚Äôs arrival in Beijing, the roads were cleared for their motorcade to the Great Hall of the People for a meeting with President Xi Jinping. Orville Schell, a China scholar at the Asia Society in New York and an adviser to the Berggruen Institute, said that Mr. Berggruen gained access to Chinese leaders because he focused on philosophy and culture, not politics and human rights, and noted that his approach was ‚Äúastute. ‚Äù It also helped that Mr. Berggruen did not appear to have a business agenda. ‚ÄúIn some ways he is a thinking man‚Äôs Donald Trump,‚Äù Mr. Schell said. ‚ÄúHe doesn‚Äôt want anything from anybody, except to be of consequence. ‚Äù While Mr. Berggruen has arrived, even in his early days he wasn‚Äôt exactly an arriviste. His father, Heinz Berggruen, was an art dealer who fled the Nazis in 1936, romanced Frida Kahlo in New York and befriended Picasso in Paris. The younger Mr. Berggruen attended Le Rosey, an exclusive Swiss boarding school, and studied finance at New York University, but he says he began investing as a teenager, borrowing a few thousand pounds from a friend to buy stocks. Forbes estimates his fortune to be about $1. 5 billion. Last year, Town  Country magazine named him one of the world‚Äôs 50 most eligible bachelors. And last month, he became a bachelor father. Or, as he put it when asked who the mother is: ‚ÄúMe. I am the mother and the father. ‚Äù Mr. Berggruen has two newborns, a boy and a girl, born three weeks apart to different surrogates and conceived using eggs from two donors. Single fatherhood has now tethered him to Los Angeles, he said, but not too tightly: He bought the apartment one floor down for the children and their nannies. Since 2015, his institute has been funded by his   charitable trust. He says it has a $1 billion endowment. Foreign status means that Mr. Berggruen forfeits United States tax breaks but can give away money as he chooses. Bermuda has almost none of the restrictions or disclosure rules that bind American nonprofits. In the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis, Mr. Berggruen said, he began to question his life‚Äôs purpose. That led him, in 2010, to hire professors from the University of California, Los Angeles, to tutor him in philosophy. Brian Walker, a political science professor and expert in Chinese philosophy, was one of those. Professor Walker would discuss Plato and Confucius with Mr. Berggruen over lunch in his suite at the Peninsula Hotel. ‚ÄúIt was sort of a surreal setting, but he always did the reading and asked good questions,‚Äù Mr. Walker said. ‚ÄúI found him a little mysterious. He didn‚Äôt invite personal confidences. ‚Äù Mr. Berggruen is courteous and even courtly: In restaurants, he stands when his date leaves the table. But he isn‚Äôt a schmoozer. His Stanford conference ran from 9 a. m. to 6 p. m. with little time for small talk. At the philosophy dinner, he asked that his guests discuss harmony and freedom in the East and West. He was playful, but only on topic. ‚ÄúI am going to say something that will make all of you want to kill me,‚Äù he said, bringing conversation and forks to a halt. ‚ÄúThe West is absolutist, India is pluralist, and China is  ‚Äî   and I don‚Äôt mean this in a negative way  ‚Äî   conformist. ‚Äù Mr. Berggruen spoke proudly of the work his Think Long Committee did to address California‚Äôs deficit, including supporting Proposition 31, which among other things would have barred lawmakers from creating expenditures over $25 million without finding the money for them. Mr. Berggruen spent more than $1 million to get the proposition on the ballot. The initiative was voted down in 2012. Think Long was on the winning side, though, of a 2014 measure to make ballot initiatives more transparent. Kathay Feng, executive director of California Common Cause, which supported the measure, said that she didn‚Äôt recall the Berggruen Institute‚Äôs adding much to policy ideas, but that it did help finance legal advisers and recruit experts. ‚ÄúI wouldn‚Äôt say it was deep thinking,‚Äù Ms. Feng said, ‚Äúbut he did bring in some very   individuals. ‚Äù In 2010, Mr. Berggruen took the Giving Pledge  ‚Äî   which has become a kind of social register for   philanthropists  ‚Äî   joining billionaires who have promised to give away more than half of their fortunes. But he is not a spendthrift. He is a trustee of the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, and tax records show that in 2014 he gave the museum $100, 000, the minimum annual gift required many give double that amount, or more, according to two trustees. That year, Mr. Berggruen gave U. C. L. A. $4, 750. Mr. Berggruen says he wants to nurture innovative thinking, not just donate to causes. His institute, he said, is ‚Äúnot just a   operation it‚Äôs an ideas and   operation. ‚Äù Several scholars say that Mr. Berggruen‚Äôs interdisciplinary approach to philosophy is refreshing in an academic world that can be siloed. Kwame Anthony Appiah, a philosopher at New York University, said he attended a Berggruen event because it gave him a chance to talk to experts about Confucianism, which is not his primary field of study. ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt say whether it‚Äôs the best use of his money,‚Äù Professor Appiah said. ‚ÄúI can only consider whether he is making the world better or worse, and in this case I would have to say, better. ‚Äù",Foregin,
"It happened so fast: One moment I was running trails, the next I was staring a   sow in the face, so close I could smell it, wild and pungent and alarming, and I knew it could smell me, too, my fear. I was in the middle of a rainy   run in Far North Bicentennial Park on the outskirts of Anchorage, where I live. It was late July, a time when grizzlies sweep down from the mountains to feast on the   salmon swimming up Campbell Creek. But I was miles from the water. I had planned my route away from the creek, and I hadn‚Äôt seen bear scat in more than an hour. As I crested a hill, a crash sounded from my right, and I instinctively moved to the left, expecting a moose. But it was the sow with three cubs. The cubs fled up a tree. The sow paused in front of me, as if waiting. I backed into the brush, fortifying myself behind a skinny grove of alder trees, moving slowly, carefully, never taking my eyes off the bear. When it veered as if to leave I felt such relief that my throat loosened and small gasps escaped my lips. Then it abruptly turned and charged directly at me. It‚Äôs impossible to run the trails around Alaska without thinking about bears. There are piles of scat everywhere, dotted with blueberry and cranberry seeds that glint in the sun, reminders that you have to be careful. You have to be versed in bear awareness, bear etiquette and bear protocol. Headphones are a   and going alone is discouraged. Making noise and carrying bear spray is recommended. Still, I often ran alone. I preferred it that way. I liked the serenity and the loneliness, liked the hours of nothing but me and the mountains and the trees. That day, I wore a bear bell attached to my hydration pack, and I sang, too, whenever I came to dense areas. I sang old rock ‚Äôn‚Äô roll songs, loudly and badly. I was cautious but not afraid. I ran these trails all summer and the summer before, and while I saw bears on many other trails, I only twice saw them on these sections. Maybe I let down my guard. Maybe I felt invincible, the way you feel when you repeat risky behavior without negative results. Maybe the bear was having a bad day. When the bear charged, time stood still. I felt every millisecond. I stood in the drizzle, rain coating my face like tears, and I did what they tell you to do if a black bear charges: I waved my arms and yelled. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm human!‚Äù I cried, my voice rising through the birch trees, through that silent and   moment. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a person!‚Äù The bear paused and ran back toward the brush. A minute later, it charged a second time. And again I waved my arms and yelled and again it stopped, this time so close I could almost reach out and touch its snout. I couldn‚Äôt breathe, couldn‚Äôt swallow. I wondered, briefly and almost idly, if this was how I would die. Suddenly, I wanted to talk to my son, who was grown and off living his own life. I wanted to hear his voice. A lifetime later, the bear turned and ran off, its backside swaying into the trees. I had to get back to the trail, to the possibility of safety, yet I couldn‚Äôt step away from the alders. It was my only protection. That‚Äôs when the bear began circling around me in a wide arc. That‚Äôs when I knew I was in trouble, became really afraid. When my son was young and nothing would comfort him, I would talk. It didn‚Äôt matter what I said, he needed my voice, the steady flow of words. As I stepped from the shelter of the alders, I talked out loud, my voice surprisingly calm. I talked to the bear to show that I meant no harm, but mostly I talked to reassure myself. As the bear circled for a second time, I stumbled through devil‚Äôs club, snagging my shorts and scratching my legs, and I talked about the day my son was born, how I recognized his face immediately. When I reached the trail, I kept talking. The bear followed, but I didn‚Äôt look back. A half a mile later, I glanced over my shoulder, and the bear was gone. I started running and didn‚Äôt stop until I encountered two hikers, and I collapsed at their feet. For weeks I saw that bear‚Äôs face in my dreams, and I woke up, heart pounding. I swore I would never run trails again, but I missed it too much, and soon I was out with the trees and that big, big sky. Some things are worth the risk, though I made sure to carry a canister of bear spray, just in case. And sometimes even now when I‚Äôm running, I think of that bear charging and how I stood there, so still and yet so alive. It opened something inside of me that can never be closed. It offered a taste of the unknown: At any time I might find myself crouched in the brush, face to face with my own fragile existence. So much of life is chance. There are no guarantees. But there are vast landscapes and dangers and wild moments of good luck.",Foregin,

"The strict French gun control that makes it extremely difficult for   citizens to defend themselves has proven little more than a paper tiger when it comes to prohibiting terrorists and public attackers from acquiring the guns they need to kill innocents. [The April 20 attack on a police patrol on the Champs √âlys√©es illustrates this perfectly in light of the fact that the alleged attacker ‚Äî  Karim Cheurfi ‚Äî  was previously jailed for shooting at officers with a . 38 Special revolver. The Daily Mail reports that Cheurfi was imprisoned ‚Äúin 2005 for trying to kill two policemen‚Äù and wounding a third person with the revolver.  On Thursday he allegedly used a Kalashnikov to kill two officers. He was then shot dead, and upon searching his car, police discovered more weapons, ‚Äúincluding a pump action shotgun. ‚Äù The University of Sydney‚Äôs GunPolicy. org describes French gun laws as ‚Äúrestrictive,‚Äù yet they were powerless to stop Cheurfi, just as they offered no hindrance to the    who entered the Alexis de Tocqueville high school in Grasse   and opened fire. Despite universal background checks ‚Äî  ‚Äúwhich [consider] criminal, mental health and [physical] health‚Äù issues ‚Äî  The Local reports the    was able to enter the school carrying ‚Äúa revolver, a pistol, a hunting rifle and two grenades. ‚Äù Consider the November 13, 2015, terror attack on unarmed Parisians. In that attack, multiple terrorists opened fire with   or   rifles. They killed 130 innocents. The universal background checks were not a hindrance, and the rest of the French gun laws were powerless to prevent the attack. It is important to note that A Review of French Gun Laws (2012) shows that the background check in France is an ongoing process rather than a one time event. Such checks entail acquiring and maintaining ‚Äúan active shooting club [membership]‚Äù and going to the range ‚Äúat least three times a year. ‚Äù They also include ‚Äúseeing a doctor every year,‚Äù who declares one ‚Äúphysically and mentally capable of owning a firearm,‚Äù and filling out various pieces of paperwork as well. Yet 130 innocents were gunned down on November 13, 2015. And we cannot overlook the January 7, 2015, attack on Charlie Hebdo headquarters. Twelve innocents ‚Äî  including two police officers ‚Äî  were gunned down by armed terrorists who were not hindered by strict gun control. French police unions responded to the Charlie Hebdo attack by explaining that gun control simply was not working for them they could not continue to walk the streets of Paris presuming that terrorists would not acquire arms. The Associated Press reported that the police unions demanded ‚Äúmore‚Äù guns and ‚Äúheavier‚Äù guns, as well as ‚Äúprotective gear, better training for   and more legal tools to guard against terrorists. ‚Äù Gun control reduces   citizens‚Äô ability to defend themselves and places police officers at a marked disadvantage. On the other hand, it poses no hindrance to determined terrorists who target citizens and police officers alike.

"52 Views October 31, 2016 GOLD , KWN King World News 
With most markets on lockdown on Halloween trading day, here is a big picture view of where the world is headed. 
Stephen Leeb: ‚ÄúThis past week a New York Times headline that caught my eye was: ‚ÄúAt Heart of U.S. Strategy; Weapons That Can Think.‚Äù The gist was that over the next few years the U.S. will be spending billions of dollars to make ‚Äúsmart‚Äù weapons, while also boosting our cyber budget by billions of dollars. It struck me as another example of how anytime we in the U.S. pound our chest about our mighty military, we always point to how much money have spent and plan to spend‚Ä¶ IMPORTANT: To hear which legend just spoke with KWN about $8,000 gold and the coming mania in the gold, silver, and mining shares markets CLICK HERE OR ON THE IMAGE BELOW. 
In a recent issue of Foreign Affairs, Michael O‚ÄôHarlan and David Petraeus, men with exceptional military pedigrees, declare: ‚ÄúU.S. forces have few, if any, weaknesses and in many areas‚Ä¶they play in a totally different league from the militaries of other countries‚Ä¶Nor is this likely to change anytime soon, as U.S. defense spending is almost three times as large as that of the United States‚Äô closest competitor, China.‚Äù 
Reassuring words? Maybe for a moment. But as soon as you think about it, they become anything but reassuring, showing that even when it comes to our most vital security issues, we make the fundamentally flawed assumption that money equates to wealth. 
I‚Äôve long been convinced that if the U.S. continues on what appears an ever more inevitable slide, historians will point to the day Nixon dropped the gold standard as launching that skid. Gold is wealth; paper is merely money. Money can facilitate the exchange of wealth, but by itself it is just paper or entries on a computer ledger and a very poor substitute for wealth. Commodities are wealth, and many vital commodities, as we pointed in a recent interview, can‚Äôt even be purchased any more ‚Äì period. Information is also wealth. And no amount of money can guarantee an edge in information. 
A few weeks ago, a 15- or 16-year-old who had recently become interested in chess wrote a letter to a chess blog asking how much he‚Äôd need to spend to become a Grand Master ‚Äì how much for training, how much for practice time, coaches, etc. The only possible answer: not all the money in the world could turn a novice who‚Äôs already a teenager into a world-class player. Grand masters have a wealth of knowledge and savvy that can‚Äôt be acquired once you‚Äôre much past 7 or 8 years old. You‚Äôve missed the boat. 
Similarly, no amount of money enabled U.S. experts to crack the cell phone of the San Bernardino terrorists. But cyber experts from Israel, which spends a lot less on cyber issues, cracked it with relative ease. Israel, along with China and Russia, are among a number of countries, mostly located in Asia, that develop the skills of their gifted children at early ages. This has left the U.S. a poor second in critical areas ranging from cyber security to super computers, which will be the most essential tools in the next generation of a gold-centered monetary system. 
Even nonbelievers should be starting to perceive the inevitability of gold replacing paper. A few metrics tell the story. First is the relationship between the dollar and economic growth. Despite the recent report of better-than-expected third-quarter GDP, the economy‚Äôs growth has been declining as the dollar has risen. In the wake of the Great Recession the dollar traded in a fairly tight range, while GDP growth in fits and starts peaked at 5 percent in the third quarter of 2014. The higher dollar has held GDP growth to less than 2 percent for the past two years. 
But commodities have begun to rise. Most major commodity indexes have climbed 10 percent or more this year. Even the temporary setback in obtaining an OPEC agreement won‚Äôt hold back real goods. Recently, for the first time since China announced its Silk Road initiative in 2013, a major article on the undertaking appeared in a major magazine, Foreign Affairs. Gal Luft , a senior advisor to the United States Energy Security Council, urged Washington to get aboard or lose out on the chance to benefit from the greatest infrastructure project in the history of civilization, many times the size of the Marshall Plan and already the destination of $1 trillion in Chinese exports this year, with dramatic growth likely for the foreseeable future. 
But instead we‚Äôre likely to continue to use our dollars in ways that bear ever less connection to real wealth. Bear in mind that any effort to hold inflation down will crumble in the face of Western economies even weaker than ours. The result is that real interest rates will remain negative, an unalloyed positive for gold. At the same time the currency used along the Silk Road will be some combination of gold, the SDR, and the yuan. As we have said before, China‚Äôs edge in critical information technologies ensures its domination in virtual currencies such as the bitcoin, which will have multiple advantages in tomorrow‚Äôs gold-based world. 
How High Will Gold & Silver Trade? How high will gold go? Much depends on how much trade the Silk Road generates. Which means that if think gold could go to five digits, you don‚Äôt need a shrink ‚Äì you‚Äôre sane as can be. And let‚Äôs not overlook gold‚Äôs poor cousin, which in the end could make you even richer, silver. The energies of our future will be anchored to solar, nuclear, and wind. The solar anchor will mean that already peaking silver will become some of the scarcest wealth around. If you‚Äôre dreaming of $100 silver, your dreams will be coming true before long. 
To me it‚Äôs an ironic footnote to the Nixon years. Yes, history will record that America‚Äôs decline began when the much-maligned Nixon delinked the dollar from gold and let us conflate money and wealth. Meanwhile, though, you can make a fortune on the coming bull market in gold that will be the direct result of that decision.‚Äù

"Rock and folk legend Bob Dylan has been accused of lifting sections of his 2016 Nobel Prize in Literature acceptance speech from a SparkNotes. com summary of Moby Dick. [Andrea Pitzer, a contributor for Slate, wrote that Dylan‚Äôs speech last week included plagiarized lines from an abridged summary of Moby Dick, the Herman Melville novel that the ‚ÄúBlowin‚Äô in the Wind‚Äù singer has cited as a personally inspiring text.  One of the phrases used in the lecture, Pitzer writes, matches wording found on SparkNotes  ‚Äî   a study guide website that provides summaries of literature and other texts  ‚Äî   but is not, however, in the classic novel. From the lecture: ‚ÄúSome men who receive injuries are led to God, others are led to bitterness‚Äù From SparkNotes: ‚Äúsomeone whose trials have led him toward God rather than bitterness. ‚Äù Pitzer highlights at least 20 examples from Dylan‚Äôs lecture of sentences and phrases that are similar to those found in the SparkNotes summary of the novel.

"What might the American economy look like if   had not engaged in decades of brutal betrayal against American workers? [A new report from the Congressional Budget Office provides an   answer to the question by examining a sector of the labor market whose wages have been largely shielded from the effects of trade deals, immigration, and   regulation. These workers receive wages and benefits that are, on average, about 17 percent higher than workers with comparable skills and education in other parts of the economy.  The compensation gap is striking. The workers in the protected sector are better compensated than unprotected peers at every level of educational attainment aside from those with professional degrees or doctorates. The compensation gap is largest, in fact, for those workers who would otherwise be among the most vulnerable in the economy: workers with no more than a high school degree. According to the CBO study, the total compensation for protected workers with a high school diploma or less earned 53 percent more than their unprotected peers. So who are these protected workers? They are members of the federal government‚Äôs civilian workforce. The federal government employs about 1. 5 percent of the U. S. workforce, around 2. 2 million workers. They are spread across more than 100 agencies and over 650 occupations. In fiscal year 2016, the federal government spent around $215 billion to compensate these workers. On average, they tend to be older, more educated, and more concentrated in professional occupations than   workers. The CBO studied data from 2011 through 2015 to estimate the differences between the wages and benefits of federal employees and similar   employees. It sorted the data by level of education, years of work experience, occupation, size of employer, geographic location, veteran status, and demographic characteristics such as ages, sex, race, and marital status. What it found was that federal workers tend to earn far more than their private sector counterparts. Between 2010 and 2015, federal workers with a high school degree or less had wages that were 34 percent higher than private sector peers and benefits that were 93 percent greater, for a total compensation gap of 53 percent. For workers with a bachelor‚Äôs degree, the wage gap was 21 percent, composed of a 5 percent wage gap and a 52 percent benefit gap. Aside from those with the highest levels of education, the compensation gap has grown in recent years. Between 2005 and 2010, for example, the total compensation gap for workers with a high school diploma or less was 36 percent. The gap for those with a bachelor‚Äôs degree was 15 percent. An adjustment to whom is counted as a federal employee caused some of this difference. But the larger part of it was caused by the fact that wages grew more quickly among less educated federal workers than those in the private sector. This is even more striking because lawmakers froze    salary increases for federal workers between 2011 through 2013. Without this freeze, the gap would have grown even larger. Federal workers are shielded from a lot of the effects of globalization that have depressed private sector worker compensation. Their jobs are not easily or often subject to   the practice of replacing employees in the U. S. with employees located in foreign countries. Similarly, outsourcing does not weigh on federal workers the way it does private sector workers. Competition from immigrants is far less of a factor because the U. S. government has stringent rules against hiring illegal immigrants and does not directly seek workers from abroad to fill jobs. While the federal government hires immigrant workers, it does so from the pool that is already legally residing in the United States. Trade hardly impacts federal worker compensation at all. Civilian federal employees working in the Defense Department, the largest group of federal workers, are not in wage competition with defense workers in foreign lands. That is true for almost all federal workers, in fact. From the Department of Agriculture and the Department of the Interior to the U. S. Treasury and the Justice Department, the wage competition faced by employees is purely domestic. Unlike the private sector, where employment and wages are depressed because of regulation, the federal government benefits from increased regulation. Each new regulation requires employees to enforce and monitor compliance. And most regulations impose few barriers to projects that the federal government pursues.  Look at it from the    of the agencies. They are confined to hiring, for the most part, American citizens and legal residents. They compete with other government agencies and the private sector for workers. While the private sector can turn abroad for workers, the federal agencies cannot. The result is higher wages and better benefits for federal workers. Importantly, many of the   sources of wage stagnation that impact the private sector also weigh on the federal sector. Communications technology, for example, has made many occupations once filled by workers in the federal government redundant. Robotics, improved computer processing, and the Great Recession ‚Äî  recall that wage   wage freeze ‚Äî  have all hit federal workers. Yet the compensation grew. That leaves the effects of trade and immigration policy as the most likely culprits. The absence of a wage gap for those with a doctorate or professional degree is telling. In the private sector, these are workers who have faired relatively well in the age of globalization. Many have seen the demand for their work ‚Äî  and therefore their prosperity ‚Äî  rise as lawyers, bankers, and other professions ply their trade internationally. So it is no surprise that the federal workers with advanced degrees earn 18 percent less than private sector counterparts. This fact also undermines a competing narrative explaining the wage gap ‚Äî  that it is a result of a reckless federal government that spends   and cannot resist pressure for higher wages. If that were so, all federal workers would be expected to earn more. The compensation gap could also explain why so many federal workers do not look favorably on President Donald Trump. They just have not experienced the economic impact of globalization the way many of Donald Trump‚Äôs private sector supporters have. The CBO report is a glimpse into a shadow world, an alternate reality of an American economy absent the trade and immigration policy decisions that have dragged down all but the best educated and highest earning segments of the American workforce. It shows us an America where a worker without a high school diploma is far better paid and the rewards to the elites are far less grand. It is the world without the carnage that globalization has sown in the American economy. It is, more hopefully, a roadmap to making America great again.",Foregin,

It‚Äôs been almost two months since Turkey launched its offensive in northern Syria.

Print Email http://humansarefree.com/2016/11/prescription-painkiller-deaths-dropped.html In all states that have legalized medical marijuana, there has been a 25% reduction in deaths related to the overdose of legally prescribed painkillers. There is still heated controversy in the United States about whether or not marijuana should be legalized for recreational use, let alone medicinal purposes. After reviewing a study published by the Journal of the American Medical Association in 2014, you‚Äôll likely agree that it‚Äôs much safer for cannabis to be doled out than most prescription opioids.For the study , researchers analyzed all deaths caused by opioid overdoses between 1999 and 2010 in the U.S.Then, they determined the association between medical cannabis laws and opioid analgesic-related deaths using linear time-series regression models. The various models helped the researchers determine that in every state that legalized medical marijuana between the aforementioned years (a total of 13 states), there was a 25% reduction in deaths related to the overdose of legally prescribed painkillers.‚Äú The difference is quite striking ,‚Äù said Colleen Barry, the study‚Äôs co-author and health policy researcher at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health in Baltimore, to Newsweek .It is hypothesized by the researchers that in states where medical marijuana is legal, patients are opting to smoke cannabis to alleviate their pain rather than consume prescription opiates, as the latter tend to cause side effects. In addition, marijuana accounts for 0 deaths per year, whereas overdose of opiates are responsible for over 14,000 deaths annually ( source ).While the statistics speak volumes, not everyone is in agreement with the findings. Dr. Andrew Kolodny, chief medical officer at the national non-profit addiction treatment agency Phoenix House, says that the immediate reduction in overdose deaths is extremely unlikely to be a result of the herb being substituted. This, he says, is because physicians rarely prescribe marijuana for chronic pain. ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt have primary care doctors in these states [prescribing] marijuana instead of Vicodin,‚Äù he argues. The physician believes that the states that have legalized medical marijuana are more likely to actively treat and help prevent addiction. In his mind, this is a far more likely scenario for the decrease in overdose deaths.While more studies undoubtedly need to be carried out to pinpoint the cause of this phenomenon, this news is heartening at the very least.

"One central fact about the global economy lurks just beneath the year‚Äôs remarkable headlines: Economic growth in advanced nations has been weaker for longer than it has been in the lifetime of most people on earth. The United States is adding jobs at a healthy clip, as a new report showed Friday, and the unemployment rate is relatively low. But that is happening despite a   trend of much lower growth, both in the United States and other advanced nations, than was evident for most of the   War II era. This trend helps explain why incomes have risen so slowly since the turn of the century, especially for those who are not top earners. It is behind the cheap gasoline you put in the car and the ultralow interest rates you earn on your savings. It is crucial to understanding the rise of Donald J. Trump, Britain‚Äôs vote to leave the European Union, and the rise of populist movements across Europe. This slow growth is not some new phenomenon, but rather the way it has been for 15 years and counting. In the United States,   gross domestic product rose by an average of 2. 2 percent a year from 1947 through 2000  ‚Äî   but starting in 2001 has averaged only 0. 9 percent. The economies of Western Europe and Japan have done worse than that. Over long periods, that shift implies a radically slower improvement in living standards. In the year 2000,   G. D. P.  ‚Äî   which generally tracks with the average American‚Äôs income  ‚Äî   was about $45, 000. But if growth in the second half of the 20th century had been as weak as it has been since then, that number would have been only about $20, 000. To make matters worse, fewer and fewer people are seeing the spoils of what growth there is. According to a new analysis by the McKinsey Global Institute, 81 percent of the United States population is in an income bracket with flat or declining income over the last decade. That number was 97 percent in Italy, 70 percent in Britain, and 63 percent in France. Like most things in economics, the slowdown boils down to supply and demand: the ability of the global economy to produce goods and services, and the desire of consumers and businesses to buy them. What‚Äôs worrisome is that weakness in global supply and demand seems to be pushing each other in a vicious circle. It increasingly looks as if something fundamental is broken in the global growth machine  ‚Äî   and that the usual menu of policies, like interest rate cuts and modest fiscal stimulus, aren‚Äôt up to the task of fixing it (though some   policies could help). The underlying reality of low growth will haunt whoever wins the White House in November, as well as leaders in Europe and Japan. An entire way of thinking about the future  ‚Äî   that children will inevitably live in a much richer country than their parents  ‚Äî   is thrown into question the longer this lasts. The first step to trying to reverse the slowdown is to understand why it‚Äôs happening. A good way to do that is to   predictions from smart economists. In January 2005, as it does every year, the Congressional Budget Office released its forecast for the United States‚Äô budget and economic outlook over the decade to come. If the C. B. O. ‚Äôs projections had come true, the United States would have had $3. 1 trillion more economic output in 2015 than it actually did  ‚Äî   17 percent more. Even if the steep contraction of   hadn‚Äôt happened, the shortfall would have been $1. 7 trillion. As a matter of arithmetic, the slowdown in growth has two potential components: people working fewer hours, and less economic output being generated for each hour of labor. Both have contributed to the economy‚Äôs underperformance. In 2000, Robert J. Gordon, a Northwestern University economist, published a paper titled ‚ÄúDoes the ‚ÄòNew Economy‚Äô Measure Up to the Great Inventions of the Past?‚Äù It argued that the internet would not have the same transformative impact on how much economic output would emerge from an hour of human labor as   innovations like electricity, air transport and indoor plumbing did. It was a distinctly minority view in that apex of technological optimism. ‚ÄúPeople said: ‚ÄòProductivity growth is exploding, Gordon. You‚Äôre wrong we‚Äôre in a new age,‚Äô ‚Äù Mr. Gordon said. But as productivity growth slowed several years later, ‚Äúpeople started to take my point of view more and more seriously. ‚Äù He offers the example of the    computer technology that airlines use. When introduced in the early 2000s, it really did mean greater productivity: Fewer airline clerks were needed for every passenger. But the gain was more a   bump than a continuing trend. Douglas   director of the C. B. O. at the time of the 2005 forecast and now president of the American Action Forum, said technology ‚Äújust seems to be less special and more comparable to other forms of investments than it had seemed. ‚Äù The forecasters thought the average output for an hour of labor would rise 29 percent from 2005 to 2014. Instead it was 15 percent. But it‚Äôs not just that each hour of work is producing less than projected. Fewer people are working fewer hours than seemed likely not long ago. The unemployment rate is actually lower than the C. B. O. projected it to be a decade ago (it saw it as stable at 5. 2 percent it was 4. 9 percent in July). But the unemployment rate counts only those actively seeking a job. There were five million fewer Americans in the labor force  ‚Äî   neither working nor looking  ‚Äî   in 2015 than projected. An analysis by the White House Council of Economic Advisers last year estimated that about half of the decline in labor force participation since 2009 was caused by aging of the population (which was anticipated in the projection) and about 14 percent from the economic cycle. About a third of the decline was a mysterious ‚Äúresidual‚Äù: younger people leaving the work force, perhaps because they saw little opportunity or viewed the potential wages they could earn as inadequate. Weak productivity and fewer workers are hits to the ‚Äúsupply‚Äù side of the economy. But there is evidence that a shortage of demand is a major part of the problem, too. Think of the economy as a car if you try to accelerate far beyond the speed it‚Äôs capable of, a car won‚Äôt go any faster but the engine will overheat. Similarly, if the voluntary exit of people from the labor force and    gains from technological advances were the entire story behind the growth slowdown, there should be evidence the economy is overheating, resulting in inflation. That‚Äôs not what‚Äôs happening. Rather, global central banks are keeping their feet on the economic accelerator, and that is not resulting in any overheating at all. The distinction is important if there is to be any hope of solving the   problem. If the issue is a shortage of demand, then some more stimulus should help. If it is entirely on the supply side, then government stimulus is not much use, and policy makers should focus on trying to make companies more innovative and coax people back into the work force. But what if it‚Äôs both? Larry Summers, the Harvard economist and a former top official in the Obama and Clinton administrations, watched as growth stayed low and inflation invisible after the 2008 crisis, despite extraordinary stimulus from central banks. Even before the crisis, economic growth had been relatively tepid despite a housing bubble, war spending and low interest rates. In November 2013, he combined those observations into a   speech at an I. M. F. conference arguing that the global economy had, just maybe, settled into a state of ‚Äúsecular stagnation‚Äù in which there was insufficient demand, and resulting slow growth, low inflation and low interest rates. While the theory is anything but settled, the case has become stronger in the last three years. But it may not be as simple as supply versus demand. Perhaps people have dropped out of the labor force because their skills and connections have atrophied. Perhaps the productivity slump is caused in part by businesses not making capital investments because they don‚Äôt think there will be demand for their products. Mr. Summers, in an interview, frames it as an inversion of ‚ÄúSay‚Äôs Law,‚Äù the notion that supply creates its own demand: that economywide, people doing the work to create goods and services results in their having the income to then buy those goods and services. In this case, rather, as he has often put it: ‚ÄúLack of demand creates lack of supply. ‚Äù His proposed solution is that the government sharply expand investment in infrastructure, which might provide a jolt of higher demand, which in turn could help the picture on supply  ‚Äî   helping workers who build roads and bridges become reattached to the work force, for example. As it happens, increasing infrastructure spending is among the few economic policies advocated by both Hillary Clinton and Mr. Trump. Economic history is full of unpredictable fits and starts. When Bill Clinton was elected in 1992, the internet, a defining feature of his presidency, was rarely mentioned, and Japan seemed to be emerging as the   economic rival of the United States. In other words, there‚Äôs a lot we don‚Äôt know about the economic future. What we do know is that if something doesn‚Äôt change from the recent trend, the 21st century will be a gloomy one.",Foregin,

And American car buyers sought out more   vehicles, turning to a country that had not yet been celebrated for automaking: Japan.

"LOS ANGELES  ‚Äî   The entire Hollywood press corps turned up. So did dozens of Chinese executives from the   Dalian Wanda Group, some of whom were introduced as ‚Äúspecial dignitaries. ‚Äù Studio executives? Check. Leaders from the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences? Grinning from the front row. But why were there also four women in gold evening gowns serving as ushers and M. C.‚Äôs? And why was the ‚ÄúStar Wars‚Äù score used as part of the Monday affair, which was held to promote Wanda‚Äôs $5 billion studio complex in Qingdao as a home away from home for Hollywood? The answer seemed to be: because Wanda wanted it that way. And, at least for eager Hollywood executives hoping to tap into the   Chinese box office, that was answer enough. As the Motion Picture Association of America‚Äôs chief executive, Christopher J. Dodd, said in a video infomercial for the Qingdao complex that played as part of the event, ‚ÄúAny time an audience grows, everyone benefits. ‚Äù The 5 p. m. presentation, held at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, began with remarks by Cheryl Boone Isaacs, president of the academy, an institution dedicated in part to celebrating artistic freedom. ‚ÄúWe have so much in common,‚Äù Ms. Boone Isaacs said of the Chinese and American film industries. ‚ÄúArt. Creativity. Conscience. Conviction. Just telling your story. ‚Äù Hollywood, of course, has been frustrated that Chinese censors restrict the flow of American films into China only a few dozen foreign films are allowed to be exhibited annually. But Ms. Boone Isaacs kept it gauzy. ‚ÄúThis art form, like an   carousel, is at its best when it takes us around the world,‚Äù she said of cinema. Next up: Eric Garcetti, the mayor of Los Angeles, who has made bolstering the movie industry a priority of his administration. Specifically, he has criticized the practice of studios moving production to other states and countries to take advantage of tax incentives and rebates. That, of course, is exactly the kind of runaway production funding that Wanda announced at Monday‚Äôs event. Mr. Garcetti tried to have it both ways. After noting that efforts to bring back production have borne fruit, he said, ‚ÄúWe also are not a place that closes in. ‚Äù He added, ‚ÄúWe will be strong about promoting Los Angeles as a place to film, but we will also be proud to make those international links that are core to our businesses growing. ‚Äù With that, Mr. Garcetti introduced Wang Jianlin, Wanda‚Äôs chairman. For his part, Mr. Wang spent most of his speech (delivered in Mandarin, with translation provided to the audience via headphones) highlighting the spectacular growth of the Chinese box office. Within a decade, he noted, China will not only far surpass the United States as a movie marketplace, it will control more than 40 percent of global ticket sales. He got a round of applause when he said that American studios needed to ‚Äúimprove the quality‚Äù of their movies. ‚ÄúIn the recent few years, perhaps because Hollywood movies are trying to minimize their risk, there are less original movies,‚Äù he said. After criticizing Hollywood‚Äôs   on special effects, he added, ‚ÄúNow that Chinese audiences are smarter, they do not so easily become happy. ‚Äù It was almost a wrap. But first came more details about the 40 percent rebate Wanda will offer studios for filming at its    ‚Äúmovie metropolis‚Äù in Qingdao. Invited to the stage were executives from studios that had already signed up, including Lionsgate,   Legendary Entertainment, Arclight Films and Kylin Pictures. As one of the women in gold gowns said in closing, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs very exciting!‚Äù",Foregin,

TPP, TTIP, TISA 
CETA: A week of pressure from four Belgian regions opposed to CETA, led by the courageous Walloons, produced a revised ‚Äújoint interpretive instrument‚Äù and, importantly, a new list of conditions that must be met before Belgium can ratify the deal‚Äù [ Rabble.ca ]. ‚ÄúUnfortunately, the joint interpretive ‚Äòinstrument‚Äô is mostly artful deception. To take just one example, the instrument‚Äôs affirmation of the right to regulate is meaningless. Of course, the parties have not entirely given up their right to regulate. But the fact is, even if the instrument had full legal force under international law, CETA would still threaten the ability of Canada or EU governments to regulate in the public interest, enhance public services, and hold multinational companies accountable for their actions. ‚ÄòThe critical point missing,‚Äô as we wrote previously, ‚Äòis that while the parties retain the right to regulate, they must do so in conformity with their CETA obligations and commitments.'‚Äù So it will be interesting to see if Obama tries a similar deception on TPP. But wait! 
Wallonia‚Äôs principled stand did, however, produce some important results. While most of the media attention in Canada appears to have focused on the joint instrument, the more interesting and potentially significant development may be the accord between Belgian governments that spells out the grounds for Belgium‚Äôs federal government to sign CETA. 
For example, Belgium will now ask the European Court of Justice to give an opinion on the legality of CETA‚Äôs investment court system within the EU. Even more importantly, four of Belgium‚Äôs regional governments also state that they reject CETA (notably its investment chapter) as negotiated and that Belgium will refuse to ratify the treaty unless these concerns are addressed. In other words, while Belgium is now in a position to sign CETA, it will not be able to ratify the deal as it stands. 
This means that CETA‚Äôs investment chapter, at a minimum, must be revised or the investment court system scrapped, before CETA can be ratified by Belgium. The accord also includes assurances that if any Belgian regional government refuses to ratify CETA, the federal government must give notice to the EU that Belgium cannot ratify, an act that could potentially trigger the end of CETA‚Äôs provisional application in all European member states. 
The German constitutional court staked out a similar position in the event that Germany fails to ratify CETA. That decision, by the way, will not be made by the German government alone, but in conjunction with Germany‚Äôs second chamber, which is currently controlled by the anti-CETA Greens and Left parties. 
So while CETA proponents have undoubtedly cleared a big albeit unanticipated hurdle in getting the deal signed, their machinations may have made CETA‚Äôs full ratification even less likely. CETA‚Äôs passage in Europe is far from assured, despite the apparent breakthrough in Belgium. 
And then there is the voice of the Canadian establishment‚Äì 
CETA: ‚ÄúCETA puts Canada‚Äôs trade debate to rest once and for all‚Äù [ Globe and Mail ]. ‚ÄúThe rationale for launching CETA in Canada was in large part to establish a measure of diversification from the country‚Äôs trade relations within the North American free-trade agreement. Given the tone around trade in the U.S. presidential election, this decision now looks especially prescient.‚Äù 
CETA: ‚ÄúWhat the Canada-EU Deal Means for the Future of Trade‚Äù [ Fortune ]. ‚ÄúAll of the factors that drove Europe to conclude this agreement provide insights for current trade challenges in the U.S. President Obama is trying to get Congress to approve just after the presidential election the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) agreement‚Ä¶ Now is the time to resolve as many specific congressional objections to the deal as possible. It is impossible to renegotiate the TPP in the time available, so as with the last-minute negotiations between the EU and Belgium, both the administration and Congress will need to be pragmatic and come to an agreement quickly on outstanding issues.‚Äù 
TISA: ‚ÄúThe 21st round of negotiations for the Trade in Services Agreement kicks off this morning in Geneva, and stakes are high for significant progress to be made this round in order for the deal to wrap up by its early December deadline. Significant issues remain, including data flows ‚Äî where the European Union is still working to come up with a consolidated position ‚Äî and new services, on which the EU and others are continuing to push for the right to apply different regulations to domestic and foreign constituents rather than afford the same treatment to all TISA partners.

Debates 
‚ÄúPresidential Candidates Dr. Jill Stein & Gov. Gary Johnson [Pt. 1]‚Äù [ Tavis Smiley ]. A forum-style ‚Äúconversation‚Äù between the two. 
‚Äú‚ÄòI had a team of people who were relentless, totally in the head of what Trump might do,‚Äô [Hillary Clinton] says‚Äù [ People ] ‚Äú‚ÄòA lot of this comes down to who gets into whose head. It‚Äôs like an athletic contest or maybe a high-stakes entertainment performance.‚Äù 
War Drums 
‚ÄúIn the five and a half years since the uprising in Syria began, it has become the most catastrophic war of our young century‚Äù [Dexter Filkins, The New Yorker ]. I would have thought that our invasion of Iraq in 2003 set the baseline for ‚Äúcatastrophic‚Äù? What the heck was Filkins thinking when he wrote that sentence? And The New Yorker used to be famous for its fact-checking. When did that get crapified, anyhow? 
The Voters 
‚Äú[W]hile Trump and many of his supporters may fetishize a past that is deeply retrograde, liberals and progressives have also demonstrated a troubling tendency to fetishize a future that they presume is on their side. There‚Äôs something peculiarly telling about this kind of progress fetishism, which has been conscripted as ideology-of-first-resort for Clintonite New Democrats‚Äù [ The Baffer ]. ‚ÄúWhen our historical terrain has effectively focused most of our political energies to differentiating ourselves from the not-woke-enough opponents of progress, we can lose all critical introspection. We can uncritically pass over the fact that, say, liberal multiculturalism can end up being really racist , tolerance of queer sexualities can end up repackaging biologically determinist languages of eugenics, and so on. Moreover, as the rise of the New Democrats has made crystal clear (from Bill and Hillary to Obama), we will dependably base our biggest political choices on our future-focused need to have our place on the right side of history confirmed. So what if that means more drone strikes, deportations, mass incarceration of minorities, destructive free trade agreements, corporate concessions, and financial deregulation? It‚Äôs messy ‚Äòmaintaining‚Äô history, after all.‚Äù 
‚ÄúEarly Voting a Poor Predictor of Final Results‚Äù [ RealClearPolitics ].

Downballot 
‚ÄúThe presidential race may be inducing whiplash, but the House battleground remains relatively stable in the final week. We rate only 40 House races in Lean or Toss Up, and Democrats would need to sweep 35 of them to win control, so Republicans remain overwhelming favorites to hold onto their majority. But there is still plenty of uncertainty about the size of that majority: Democrats could gain anywhere from 5 to 20 seats‚Äù [ Cook Political Report ]. ‚Äù Republican voters have begun coming home to Donald Trump amid the Comey news‚Ä¶ Even if control is not at risk, the ultimate size of the GOP majority matters a great deal, especially to Speaker Paul Ryan. To the extent Republicans lose seats, almost all of the casualties will be swing-district moderates who are more loyal to Ryan than Trump. The narrower the majority, the less room for error Ryan will have in winning reelection to his position and navigating the 2017 legislative minefield.‚Äù

‚ÄúSEPTA strike halts transit service in Philadelphia‚Äù [ Progressive Railroading ]. Effect on voting? 
‚Äú[T]he race between [Clinton and Trump] is now a precise dead heat in the latest ABC News/Washington Post tracking poll, 46-46 percent. A majority, 55 percent, continues to expect Clinton to win, though that‚Äôs down 5 points from its peak last week‚Äù [ ABC ]. ‚Äù Among other results is a gradual collapse in support for Libertarian Party candidate Gary Johnson, from a peak of 9 percent support in September to just 3 percent now. Jill Stein of the Green Party has 2 percent and has held steady.‚Äù Amazingly, Trump now leads on honesty and trustworthiness. Of course, it‚Äôs madness to focus on individual polls; RCP‚Äôs 4-way average has Clinton up by 1.9, though falling. 
‚ÄúWith the fallout over the FBI email probe continuing to take up oxygen, Trump has stayed uncharacteristically on message. Campaigning near Philadelphia on Tuesday, the GOP nominee and his running mate focused on the projected 25 percent average increase in premiums for some Affordable Care Act plans, as open enrollment began. Trump let Mike Pence do most of the talking, and the Indiana governor closed his remarks on repealing the law by asking Republicans to ‚Äúcome home'‚Äù [ RealClearPolitics ]. Hitherto, Trump has been the anti-Napoleon, always interrupting his enemy when they are making a mistake. Not so this week (though there are 5 days to go). Kellyanne Conway must have gotten Trump‚Äôs attention somehow. Or Ivanka. 
‚ÄúDonald Trump Voters, Just Hear Me Out‚Äù [The Moustache of Understanding, New York Times ]. Four paragraphs in, he turns to the topic of Trump: ‚ÄúTrump is not only a flawed politician, he‚Äôs an indecent human being.‚Äù Persuasive! I dunno. If a vote for Trump would finally force Friedman off the Times Op-Ed page, would it be worth it? Tough call. 
Realignment 
‚ÄúWill this be the election that finally kills off the Democratic and Republican parties?‚Äù [ McClatchy ]. ‚ÄúJust days before Election Day, interviews with more than 40 independent voters in swing states underscores that the nomination of two deeply unpopular candidates for president is aggravating and reinforcing a growing trend in the country away from the Democratic and Republican parties, which more and more voters see as out of touch with their lives and out of date in a new century. The number of free agent voters registering as independent or unaffiliated is soaring, while Republican and Democratic numbers flatline. Independent registrations have jumped since 2008 by 22.3 percent in states that keep registration data by party. Democrats over that same time increased 2.7 percent and Republicans 3.6 percent‚Ä¶‚Äù

Democrat Email Hairball 
‚ÄúOpinion: Hillary Clinton is irreparably damaged, even if she wins‚Äù [ MarketWatch ]. ‚Äú[W]e are in for a fiasco in politics that will make even this fiasco of a campaign pale by comparison. There is hardly any scenario that is too far-fetched. Even if the polls are right and Clinton‚Äôs lead translates into an electoral victory, she will be so damaged going into office that her chances of getting anything done will be virtually nil. In this sense alone, Trump‚Äôs claim that this scandal is ‚Äúworse than Watergate‚Äù could prove to be true. As an incumbent, Richard Nixon at least had an administration in place when he won re-election in 1972, though it took nearly another two years before he was forced to resign under threat of impeachment.‚Äù 
‚ÄúU.S. Sen. Ron Johnson said Monday he believes Hillary Clinton‚Äôs actions with her private email server are impeachable offenses should she be elected president‚Äù [ Beloit Daily News ]. ‚ÄúJohnson cited 18 U.S. Code 793 (f) and 18 U.S. Code 2071, which have to do with the willful destruction or removal from proper custody of information relating to national defense. Johnson honed in on the latter of the two, which reads in part that anyone found to have concealed or removed records ‚Äòshall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than three years, or both; and shall forfeit his office and be disqualified from holding any office under the United States.‚Äô‚ÄòI‚Äôm not a lawyer, but this is clearly written,‚Äô Johnson said. ‚ÄòI would say yes, high crime or misdemeanor, I believe she is in violation of both laws.'‚Äù In principle, I agree. If a high official can privatize their communications, and then decide what to destroy and what to retain before turning them over to law enforcement, the term ‚Äúpublic records‚Äù becomes literally meaningless. Nixon, deep within his withered and wormy soul, retained a shred of conscience: He didn‚Äôt simply destroy the tapes . Clinton would have destroyed the tapes without hesitation; in fact, that‚Äôs exactly what she did with ‚Äúher‚Äù‚Äî that is, the public‚Äôs ‚Äî mail. 
‚ÄúWisconsin Rep. Jim Sensenbrenner told conservative radio host Charlie Sykes Tuesday that there would be a ‚Äòconstitutional crisis‚Äô if Clinton was indicted, and when asked about impeachment, answered, ‚ÄòI think that is something that is speculative in nature. I‚Äôm speculating, what I can say is that I think Richard Nixon would have been indicted and he would have been impeached. He stopped the impeachment by resigning as a result of Watergate and he stopped the indictment by President Ford pardoning him‚Äù [ CNN ]. On pardons, see Jerri-Lynn‚Äôs post today .

‚ÄúI used to think there was no rational argument for civilian possession of military-style weapons. But in light of the disparate treatment of the armed Malheur National Wildlife Refuge occupiers (who were acquitted of all charges Friday) and the protesters in North Dakota supporting the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation in its fight against construction of an oil pipeline, it‚Äôs apparent that such weapons are now an effective component of the protester‚Äôs toolkit‚Äù [Letter to the Editor, Los Angeles Times ]. Well, the difference isn‚Äôt that the Malheur occupiers were white, given that the (sadly but mostly) white Occupy movement was treated to a 17-city coordinated paramilitary crackdown orchestrated by Obama‚Äôs DHS; the difference is that they were right wing (and white). So the Sioux are both the ‚Äúwrong‚Äù color, and their cause is percieved by the country at large as on the left (though I think the Sioux themselves would reject that framework).

"Breakdown of the Clinton Money Machine November 12, 2016 
As troubling as Donald Trump‚Äôs election may be, it carries greater hope for some positive good than the alternative of Hillary Clinton, who represented a corrupt, money-churning machine, writes John Chuckman. 
By John Chuckman 
Brushing away the extreme claims and rhetoric of much election analysis, there are some observations, which deserve attention and which unfortunately mostly provide hard lessons (and not a lot of encouragement for people who hold to principles of democracy, enlightenment and progressivity). 
The election demonstrated perhaps better than ever, and better than has been generally recognized, that America is, indeed, a plutocracy. It took a genuine American oligarch, a self-proclaimed billionaire, a man with a lifetime‚Äôs economic empire-building, to defeat a family which could provide the very definition of being politically well-connected, a family which had laboriously constructed and carefully maintained a kind of deep well ever-flowing with money for their ambitions. President Bill Clinton, First Lady Hillary Clinton and daughter Chelsea parade down Pennsylvania Avenue on Inauguration Day, Jan. 20, 1997. (White House photo) 
It was the ever-flowing well of money, drilled by Bill Clinton with help from some extremely shady friends, such as Jeffrey Epstein, that made the Clintons keystone establishment figures in the Democratic Party. It was not personal charm or exceptional political generalship ‚Äì although Bill, in his heyday, displayed some of both of those ‚Äì that earned the Clintons their place, it was the money, the ‚Äúmother‚Äôs milk of politics.‚Äù In what is euphemistically called ‚Äúfund raising,‚Äù many hundreds of millions of dollars were provided for the party over the last couple of decades by Bill Clinton‚Äôs efforts. 
Hillary Clinton fully appreciated the fact that money buys power and influence. She lacked Bill‚Äôs superficial charm, but she certainly more than shared his ambition. On the charm front, when she was ready to move into running for office, she adopted, perhaps under Bill‚Äôs tutelage, a kind of forced set of expressions with arched eyebrows, bugged-out eyes, and a smile as big as her lips would allow. These expressions were accompanied by little gestures such as briefly pointing to various onlookers or waving helter-skelter whenever she campaigned. 
Her gestures reminded me of something you might see atop a float in a Christmas Parade or of the late Harpo Marx at his most exuberant. These were not natural for her. They were never in evidence years ago when she spent years as a kind of bizarre executive housewife, both in a governor‚Äôs mansion and later in the White House, bizarre because she indulged her husband‚Äôs non-stop predatory sexual behavior in exchange for the immense power it conferred on her behind the scenes over her far more outgoing and successful politician-husband. 
Money Talks 
Anyway, Hillary knew that gestures and simulated charm do not get you far in American politics. She determined to build a political war chest long ago, and there are many indications over the years of her working towards this end of making this or that change in expressed view, as when running for the Senate, when sources of big money suggested another view would be more acceptable. She was anything but constant in the views that she embraced because when she ran for the Senate she spent record amounts of money, embarrassingly large amounts. U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton meets with Saudi King Abdullah in Riyadh on March 30, 2012. [State Department photo] In her years of speaking engagements, she aimed at special interests that could supply potentially far more money than just exorbitant speaking fees. Later, in the influential, appointed post of Secretary of State ‚Äì coming, as it does, into personal contact with every head of government or moneyed, big-time international schemer ‚Äì she unquestionably played an aggressive ‚Äúpay for play‚Äù with them all. It appears that covering up that embarrassing and illegal fact is what the private servers and unauthorized smart phones were all about.
A second big fact of the election is that both major American political parties are rather sick and fading. The Republican Party has been broken for a very long time. It hobbled along for some decades with the help of various gimmicks, hoping to expand its constituency with rubbish like ‚Äúfamily values,‚Äù public prayer in schools and catering to the Christian Right ‚Äì along with anti-flag burning Constitutional amendments ‚Äî and now it is truly out of gas. 
The Republican Party had been given a breather, some new life, by Ronald Reagan in the 1980s. He had an extremely mixed record as President, but he was popular, held in some affection, and did have a clear vision, but his effect on the party was not lasting. Trump could be seen as another Reagan, but I think the comparison is superficial. Trump literally hijacked the party. He was not deliriously crowned by its establishment. 
The Republican Party itself was formed not long before Abraham Lincoln‚Äôs candidacy out of the remains of worn out and collapsed predecessors, including the Whigs and Free-Soil Democrats. Parties do not last forever, and here was Trump creating something of a minor political revolution inside a tired and fairly directionless old party, a phenomenon which I do not think was sufficiently noticed. 
In the Republican primaries, he was opposed by tired, boring men like Jeb Bush, seeking to secure an almost inherited presidency, and a dark, intensely unlikable, phony Christian fundamentalist like Ted Cruz, and it proved to be no contest. Trump‚Äôs capture of the GOP nomination was a remarkable political achievement, but I think it was only possible given the sorry state of the party. 
The press was too busy attacking Trump from the start to take notice or do any intelligent analysis, and he was attacked precisely for the potential damage to the Establishment that he represented. His most promising quality was his potential for creating a new coalition of interests and one excluding the continuation of the Neocon Wars that Hillary Clinton embraced and promised to expand. 
A Democratic Party in Trouble 
But the Democratic Party is in serious trouble, too. It has a great deal of internal rot, as the WikiLeaks material from the Democratic National Committee clearly shows us. Arrogance, lack of direction, ignorance of the people whom the party has always claimed to serve, bad decision-making, and the absolute prostrate worship of money are the major symptoms. Sen. Bernie Sanders and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton at a Democratic presidential debate sponsored by CNN. 
It would have been impossible for the party to have so made up its mind and committed its resources to Hillary Clinton without serious rot. She has always had strong negatives in polling, always been (rightly) suspected concerning her honesty. 
The WikiLeaks material tells us about many internal conflicts, including harsh high-level judgments of Hillary‚Äôs decision-making, resentment over the backstabbing character of daughter Chelsea who is said to resemble Hillary in her behavior and attitudes, and the belief of some that Hillary just should not have run. 
And, frankly, Hillary Clinton had become for many a rather tiresome, used-up figure from whom absolutely nothing spectacular in politics or policy could possibly be expected. But they not only blindly supported her, they broke all their own party rules by internally and secretly working to defeat a legitimate and viable contender, Bernie Sanders. 
Sanders might well have been able to win the election for the Democrats, but their establishment was blind to the possibility and rejected his candidacy out-of-hand. After all, there were Bill and Hillary beckoning toward their running well of money. 
In hindsight, it might be just as well that Sanders was cheated out of the nomination. He proved a weak individual in the end, giving in to just the forces that he had claimed to oppose and leaving his enthusiastic followers completely let down. There he was, out on the hustings, supporting everything he ever opposed as personified in Hillary Clinton. Men of that nature do not stand up well to Generals and Admirals and the heads of massive corporations, a quality which I do think we have some right to expect Trump to display. 
Public Distrust 
Another important fact about the election is that it was less the triumph of Trump than the avoidance of Hillary that caused the defeat. The numbers are unmistakable. Yes, Trump did well for a political newcomer and a very controversial figure, but Hillary simply did badly, not approaching the support Obama achieved in key states, again something reflecting the documented fact that she is not a well-liked figure and the Party blundered badly in running her. President-elect Donald Trump 
But again, money talks, and the Clintons, particularly Bill, are the biggest fundraisers they have had in our lifetime. No one was ready to say no to the source of all that money. 
Now, to many Americans, the election result must seem a bit like having experienced something of a revolution, although a revolution conducted through ballots, any other kind being literally impossible by design in this massive military-security state. 
In a way, it does represent something of a revolutionary event, owing to the fact that Trump the Oligarch is in his political views a bit of a revolutionary or at least a dissenter from the prevailing establishment views. And, as in any revolution, even a small one, there are going to be some unpleasant outcomes. 
The historical truth of politics is that you never know from just what surprising source change may come. Lyndon Johnson, life-long crooked politician and the main author of the horrifying and pointless Vietnam War, did more for the rights of black Americans than any other modern president. Franklin Roosevelt, son of wealthy establishment figures, provided remarkable leadership in the Great Depression, restoring hopes and dreams for millions. 
Change, important, change, never comes from establishments or institutions like political parties. It always comes from unusual people who seem to step out of their accustomed roles in life with some good or inspired ideas and have the drive and toughness to make them a reality. 
I have some limited but important hopes for Trump. I am not blind or delirious expecting miracles from this unusual person, and after the experience of Barack Obama, who seemed such a promising young figure but fairly quickly proved a crushing, bloody disappointment, I can never build up substantial hopes for any politician. And what was the choice anyway? Hillary Clinton was a bought-and-paid one-way ticket to hell. 
Trump offers two areas of some hope, and these both represent real change. The first is in reducing America‚Äôs close to out-of-control military aggressiveness abroad. This aggressiveness, reflecting momentum from what can only be called the Cheney-Rumsfeld Presidency, continued and grew under the weak and ineffectual leadership of Obama and was boosted and encouraged by Hillary as Secretary of State. 
Hillary did a lot of killing during her tenure inside the federal government, advocating and promoting military interventions as First Lady, U.S. Senator and Secretary of State. She along with Obama is responsible for the deaths of tens of thousands of men, women and children, many of them literally torn apart by bombs. 
Welfare of Americans 
The other area of some hope is for the welfare of ordinary Americans who have been completely ignored by national leaders for decades. George W. Bush‚Äôs lame reaction to Hurricane Katrina (before he was internationally shamed into some action) has become the normal pattern for America‚Äôs national government when it comes to ordinary Americans. President Franklin Delano Roosevelt at a press conference. 
Inside the Democratic Party, the truth is that the legacy of FDR has withered to nothing and no longer plays any role, and of course never did in the Republican Party. By welfare, I do not mean the kind of state assistance to the poor that Bill Clinton himself worked to end. Nothing can impress someone not familiar with America‚Äôs dark corners more than a visit to places like Detroit or Gary or Chicago‚Äôs South Side, parts of New Orleans, or Newark or dozens of other places where Americans live in conditions in every way comparable to Third World hellholes. 
No, I mean the people‚Äôs general well-being. Trump‚Äôs approach will be through jobs and creating incentives for jobs. I don‚Äôt know whether he can succeed, but, just as he asked people in some of his speeches, ‚ÄúWhat do you have to lose?‚Äù Just having someone in power who pays any attention to the ‚Äúdeplorables‚Äù is a small gain. 
People should never think of the Clintons as liberal or progressive, and that was just as much true for Bill as it is for Hillary. His record as President ‚Äì apart from his embarrassing behavior in the Oval Office with a young female intern and his recruitment of Secret Service guards as procurers for women he found attractive on his morning runs ‚Äì was actually pretty appalling. 
In his own words, he ‚Äúended welfare as we know it.‚Äù He signed legislation that would send large numbers of young black men to prison. He also signed legislation that contributed to the country‚Äôs later financial collapse under George W. Bush. He often would appoint someone decent and then quickly back off, leaving them dangling, when it looked like approval for the appointment would not be coming. 
His FBI conducted the assault on Waco, killing about 80 people needlessly. A pharmaceutical plant in Sudan was destroyed by cruise missiles for no good reason. There were a number of scandals that were never fully explained to the public. 
It was his Secretary of State, Madeleine Albright, who answered, unblinkingly, a television interviewer‚Äôs question about a half million Iraqi children who died owing to America‚Äôs embargo, ‚ÄúWe think the price is worth it.‚Äù He committed the war crime of bombing Belgrade, including the intentional destruction of the Serb TV building. When news of the horrors of the Rwanda genocide were first detected by his government, the order secretly went out to shut up about it. No effort was made to intervene in that case. 
No, any real change in America could never come from people like the Clintons, either one of them.

"LOS ANGELES  ‚Äî   Foreign governments concerned about climate change may soon be spending more time dealing with Sacramento than Washington.   Donald J. Trump has packed his cabinet with nominees who dispute the science of global warming. He has signaled he will withdraw the United States from the Paris climate agreement. He has belittled the notion of global warming and attacked policies intended to combat it. But California  ‚Äî   a state that has for 50 years been a leader in environmental advocacy  ‚Äî   is about to step unto the breach. In a show of defiance, Gov. Jerry Brown, a Democrat, and legislative leaders said they would work directly with other nations and states to defend and strengthen what were already far and away the most aggressive policies to fight climate change in the nation. That includes a legislatively mandated target of reducing carbon emissions in California to 40 percent below 1990 levels by 2030. ‚ÄúCalifornia can make a significant contribution to advancing the cause of dealing with climate change, irrespective of what goes on in Washington,‚Äù Mr. Brown said in an interview. ‚ÄúI wouldn‚Äôt underestimate California‚Äôs resolve if everything moves in this extreme climate denial direction. Yes, we will take action. ‚Äù The prospect of California‚Äôs elevated role on climate change is the latest sign of how this state, where Hillary Clinton defeated Mr. Trump by more than four million votes, is preparing to resist the policies of the incoming White House. State and city officials have already vowed to fight any attempt by Washington to crack down on undocumented immigrants Los Angeles officials last week set aside $10 million to help fund the legal costs of residents facing deportation. The environmental effort poses decided risks for this state. For one thing, Mr. Trump and Republicans have the power to undercut California‚Äôs climate policies. The Trump administration could reduce funds for the state‚Äôs vast research community  ‚Äî   including two national laboratories  ‚Äî   which has contributed a great deal to climate science and energy innovation, or effectively nullify state regulations on clean air emissions and automobile fuel standards. ‚ÄúThey could basically stop enforcement of the Clean Air Act and CO2 emissions,‚Äù said Hal Harvey, president of Energy Innovation, a policy research group in San Francisco. ‚ÄúThat would affect California because it would constrain markets. It would make them fight political and legal battles rather than scientific and technological ones. ‚Äù And some business leaders warned that California‚Äôs embrace of environmental regulations  ‚Äî   from emission reductions to new regulations imposing mandatory energy efficiency standards on computers and monitors  ‚Äî   could put it at a disadvantage, all the more so as conservatives elsewhere move to roll back environmental regulations. ‚ÄúIf the other states pursue    policies, and we continue to go it on our own with our climate change policies, then we would be at a competitive disadvantage for either relocating companies or growing companies here, particularly manufacturing factories,‚Äù said Rob Lapsley, the president of the California Business Roundtable. When California enacted its climate reduction standards last year, it drew fierce criticism from state business leaders. The bills ‚Äúimpose very severe caps on the emission of greenhouse gases in California, without requiring the regulatory agencies to give any consideration to the impacts on our economy, disruptions in everyone‚Äôs daily lives or the fact that California‚Äôs population will grow almost 50 percent between 1990 and 2030,‚Äù the California Chamber of Commerce said. The Trump transition team did not respond to a request for comment Democrats relish the prospect of challenging Mr. Trump on climate change, noting that other states have followed California in trying to curb emissions. And California has the weight to get into the ring: It is one of the 10 largest economies in the world, with a gross domestic product of approximately $2. 5 trillion. ‚ÄúCalifornia more than ever is strongly committed to moving forward on our climate leadership,‚Äù said Kevin de Leon, the leader of the State Senate. ‚ÄúWe will not deviate from our leadership because of one election. ‚Äù The state has been at the forefront of climate and energy policy for more than half a century, beginning with setting appliance and vehicle emissions standards in the 1960s. Those policies will continue, analysts said, in no small part because they are overwhelmingly popular here: 69 percent of Californians said they supported the law requiring the state to roll back emissions in a July survey conducted by the Public Policy Institute of California. ‚ÄúThis is not something that‚Äôs going to be fueled by dislike of Donald Trump,‚Äù said Adrienne Alvord, the western states director for the Union of Concerned Scientists. ‚ÄúThis will be fueled by people liking these policies and wanting to see them continue. Our leadership and the people of California support the science. ‚Äù Ms. Alvord said that in the new political climate, the   industry may feel emboldened to take on some of the state‚Äôs energy and climate initiatives. ‚ÄúBut they would be fighting a very uphill battle,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúPolitically, it‚Äôs going to be very difficult to really slow this train down. ‚Äù California‚Äôs economy is powered by a   industry and prominent research institutions that make it well placed to continue to lead on energy and climate. The state has already taken on an international role. Mr. Brown has spearheaded the Under 2 MOU initiative, backed by a coalition of state, local and regional governments in 33 countries  ‚Äî   more than 160 jurisdictions with a total population of more than 1 billion  ‚Äî   that have agreed to deep emissions cuts to try to keep global warming to less than 2 degrees Celsius, or 3. 6 degrees Fahrenheit. California‚Äôs    program, which imposes a limit on greenhouse gas emissions and allows companies to buy and sell emissions credits, is linked with one in Quebec. The program has suffered recently from weak sales, and it is facing a legal challenge from the state Chamber of Commerce. Its future is likely to be the subject of debate by the Legislature. State officials have also had discussions with other countries, including Mexico and China, about joining forces on    policies. Domestically, California has long been a leader on vehicle emissions. The federal Environmental Protection Agency allowed it to have tougher standards under the 1970 Clean Air Act, and more than a dozen states have adopted its standards. The Trump administration could deny the state a new waiver, as the George W. Bush administration did, which would lead to a court fight. The   initiatives here have become an intricate part of the economy and a source of growth and jobs. Federal cutbacks would no doubt hurt the state to some extent, but analysts say the very   policies that may soon come under attack by the new administration have been a significant factor in California‚Äôs economic reversal. ‚ÄúIf the   and his administration work to undermine our climate leadership, they will hurt our economy,‚Äù Mr. de Leon said. ‚ÄúThey will kill jobs. And ultimately, they will hurt the economy of the United States. We are 13 percent of the overall G. D. P. ‚Äù Still, California officials and environmentalists said climate measures in place here will undoubtedly be undercut if the Trump administration rolls back environmental policies put in place by President Obama. ‚ÄúOur system works better  ‚Äî   our    system and other ways of addressing climate change  ‚Äî   if we have more company,‚Äù said Anthony Rendon, the speaker of the Assembly. ‚ÄúThe more company we have, the better. ‚Äù Dan Jacobson, the state director of Environment California, said the state can ‚Äúkeep doing what we are doing, leading the way. ‚Äù ‚ÄúBut will that be enough, soon enough? Not without the partnership of other cities, states, and nations. So that‚Äôs why it‚Äôs so dangerous for Trump to pull out of the accord,‚Äù he wrote in an email, referring to the Paris climate agreement. Mr. Brown will be a critical player in this fight. He has presented himself as an environmental advocate since he first served as governor in the 1970s. As he enters what will probably be his last two years in public life, he has seized on the prospect of leading an   environmental movement. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve got the lawyers and we‚Äôve got the scientists and are ready to fight,‚Äù Mr. Brown declared in a speech in San Francisco earlier this month to the American Geophysical Union. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre ready to win. ‚Äù Mr. Brown, in the interview, called Mr. Trump‚Äôs election a setback for the climate movement, but predicted that it would be fleeting. ‚ÄúIn a paradoxical way, it could speed up the efforts of leaders in the world to take climate change seriously,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThe shock of official congressional and presidential denial will reverberate through the world. ‚Äù",Foregin,

""The Veliki Novgorod submarine has been through all government certification tests. All of the previous submarines in that series built for the Black Sea Fleet have confirmed the expected parameters, too,"" Buzakov said. 
The Veliki Novgorod is the fifth in the group of six submarines of project 636.3 (Varshavyanka) built for the Black Sea Fleet. The first two - The Novorossiysk and The Rostov-on-Don were delivered in 2014, and another two, The Stary Oskol and The Krasnodar, in 2015. By the end of this year the Russian Navy will have the sixth submarine in the series, The Kolpino. The flag-hoisting ceremony is due November 25. 
Another six Varshavyanka subs will be built at the Admiralty shipyards for the Pacific Fleet. The contract was signed at the Army-2016 forum near Moscow. The last submarine in the second group is to be delivered in 2021.

"It may not qualify as a   eureka moment, but Jeffrey R. Immelt, chief executive of General Electric, recalls the June day in 2009 that got him thinking. He was speaking with G. E. scientists about new jet engines they were building, laden with sensors to generate a trove of data from every flight  ‚Äî   but to what end? That data could someday be as valuable as the machinery itself, if not more so. But G. E. couldn‚Äôt make use of it. ‚ÄúWe had to be more capable in software,‚Äù Mr. Immelt said he decided. Maybe G. E.  ‚Äî   a maker of power turbines, jet engines, locomotives and   equipment  ‚Äî   needed to think of its competitors as Amazon and IBM. Back then, G. E. was returning to its   roots and navigating the global financial crisis, shedding much of its bloated finance arm, GE Capital. That winnowing went on for years as billions of dollars in assets were sold, passing a milestone this summer when GE Capital was removed from the government‚Äôs short list of financial institutions deemed ‚Äútoo big to fail. ‚Äù But in 2011, G. E. also quietly opened a software center in San Ramon, Calif. 24 miles east of San Francisco, across the bay. Today one of San Ramon‚Äôs most important projects is to build a computer operating system, but on an industrial scale  ‚Äî   a Microsoft Windows or Google Android for factories and industrial equipment. The project is central to G. E.‚Äôs drive to become what Mr. Immelt says will be a ‚Äútop 10 software company‚Äù by 2020. Silicon Valley veterans are skeptical. ‚ÄúG. E. is trying to do this the way a big company does, by throwing thousands of people and billions of dollars at it,‚Äù said Thomas M. Siebel, a technology entrepreneur who is now chief executive of C3 IoT, a   that has done work for G. E. ‚ÄúBut they‚Äôre not software people. ‚Äù The San Ramon complex, home to GE Digital, now employs 1, 400 people. The buildings are designed to suit the   working ways of software developers:   floors, bench seating, whiteboards, couches for impromptu meetings, balconies overlooking the grounds and kitchen areas with snacks. Many industries see digital threats, of course. Yet the scope of the challenge is magnified at G. E. a    company and the nation‚Äôs largest manufacturer, with more than 300, 000 employees worldwide. Employees companywide have been making pilgrimages to San Ramon for technology briefings, but also to soak in the culture. Their marching orders are to try to adapt the digital wizardry and   habits of Silicon Valley to G. E.‚Äôs world of industrial manufacturing. G. E.‚Äôs success or failure over the next decade, Mr. Immelt says, depends on this transformation. He calls it ‚Äúprobably the most important thing I‚Äôve worked on in my career. ‚Äù Apparently, there is no Plan B. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs this or bust,‚Äù he said. The march of digital technology  ‚Äî   mainly inexpensive sensors, powerful computing and clever software  ‚Äî   into the industrial world has been underway for years under the guise of ‚Äúthe internet of things‚Äù or ‚Äúthe industrial internet. ‚Äù It is the next battlefield as companies fight to develop the dominant software layer that connects the machines. It promises to be a huge market for new products, improved service and efficiency gains in industries like energy, transportation and health care. By 2020, the industrial internet market will reach $225 billion, G. E. executives predicted in a recent meeting with analysts. So far, a major application has been predictive maintenance. Software analyzes the data generated by a machine to identify early warning signals that it needs repair, before it breaks down. The data volumes are exploding as machines new and old spawn sensors. By 2020, G. E. estimates that the data flowing off its machines in use will jump a hundredfold. That should enable far more detailed analysis, giving G. E. a chance to sell its customers not machines but ‚Äúbusiness outcomes,‚Äù like fuel savings. Mr. Immelt sees this as a move up the industrial food chain. Yet all of this exposes G. E. to new competition beyond its traditional rivals like Rockwell Automation, Siemens and United Technologies. Tech giants, including Amazon, Cisco, Google, IBM and Microsoft also have their eye on the industrial internet market, as do a bevy of  . There is precedent for trouble in other industries, of course. Google and Facebook transformed media and advertising, Amazon redefined retailing, and Uber applied an entirely new business model to taxis, which hadn‚Äôt changed much in generations. ‚ÄúThe real danger is that the data and analysis becomes worth more than the installed equipment itself,‚Äù said Karim R. Lakhani, a professor at the Harvard Business School. ‚ÄúG. E. has no choice but to try to do that itself. ‚Äù Recently, G. E. has lured software engineers and data scientists from Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google. Early on, though, it struggled simply to hire. Last year it began running   television ads, featuring young hires, aimed at closing the company‚Äôs image gap of industrial giant but digital midget. (Applications at GE Digital jumped eightfold, the company says.) Until this year, Darren Haas hadn‚Äôt thought about G. E. certainly not working there. To him, G. E. meant little more than than kitchen appliances and light bulbs. ‚ÄúI had no idea,‚Äù Mr. Haas said. But he was intrigued after he met with Harel Kodesh, an expert in mobile and cloud computing who led teams at Microsoft and VMware, a maker of   software. Less than two years ago, Mr. Kodesh joined G. E. and he is now chief technology officer of GE Digital. That someone of Mr. Kodesh‚Äôs caliber was a G. E. convert got Mr. Haas‚Äôs attention. Then, Mr. Haas started grasping the role that G. E. equipment plays across the economy  ‚Äî   in transportation, in hospitals  ‚Äî   ‚Äúa whole world,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI found that really, really compelling. ‚Äù The other thing Mr. Haas, 41, found appealing was the big computing challenge that lies ahead for the company. In May, he joined G. E. from Apple, where he was a member of the founding team at Siri, the   digital assistant   Apple acquired in 2010. When he left Apple, Mr. Haas was head of cloud engineering, managing the computing engine behind Siri, iTunes and iCloud. At GE Digital, Mr. Haas has a similar title, head of platform cloud engineering, but in a different setting. He describes his job as applying modern software technology  ‚Äî   machine learning, artificial intelligence and cloud computing  ‚Äî   to the industrial arena. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve got my work cut out for me,‚Äù he said. Mr. Haas is working on the centerpiece of G. E.‚Äôs software strategy, a product called Predix. Its evolution mirrors G. E.‚Äôs software ambitions. Predix began as little more than a brand of software used by G. E. to service the gear it sells. One showcase use was in jet engines to do predictive maintenance, saving downtime. Around 2013, William Ruh, a former Cisco Systems executive brought in to put together the San Ramon software center, started expanding Predix to other G. E. industrial businesses. But that soon felt too small. The issue was ‚Äúoutside disrupters,‚Äù Mr. Ruh said, citing the online lodging   Airbnb as an example of rivals that can appear seemingly out of nowhere and that ‚Äúbring greater productivity  ‚Äî   but don‚Äôt own the assets they sell. ‚Äù G. E. Mr. Ruh notes, is the ultimate   company. The other threat was rising interest among tech companies to take their internet connectivity expertise and try to apply it to industrial businesses. To get ahead of all this, G. E. reimagined Predix as a   operating system for industrial applications. Mr. Kodesh leads that effort. He ticks off the looming competitors: Amazon Web Services, Google, Microsoft and others. ‚ÄúThose companies are going to encroach on the territory,‚Äù Mr. Kodesh said. ‚ÄúAre we going to capitulate, or build something like Predix?‚Äù The basic idea is that G. E. and outside software developers will write programs to run on Predix. This software might, for instance, monitor the health and   the operation of equipment like   rigs and   turbines, improving performance, reducing wear and adapting to changing environmental conditions. It amounts to software delivering the equivalent of personalized medicine for machines. Like any other computer operating system, Predix aims to take the complexity out of writing programs, so more people can create them. And while the instincts of the industrial world are proprietary, G. E. is following an   model with Predix, providing a basic design, but one open to outside contributors  ‚Äî   more like Android from Google than Windows from Microsoft. Predix, Mr. Kodesh said, will be improved using the software equivalent of Lego blocks. ‚ÄúSome will be G. E.‚Äôs, and some will be made by   developers,‚Äù he said. G. E. is betting that its deep knowledge of industry will give it an edge in this software arms race. The stakes for this kind of programming can be high. For a regular consumer using the internet, a misfiring algorithm in the software  ‚Äî   ‚Äúa false positive‚Äù  ‚Äî   might mean a person sees an irrelevant online ad, or a bad Amazon book suggestion or Netflix movie recommendation, Mr. Kodesh said. Useless, perhaps, but not necessarily costly. But a false positive that prompts an airline to take a jet engine off the wing, Mr. Kodesh said, is a $100, 000 mistake. ‚ÄúWe really do need to have different technology, different algorithms and a different cloud, than in the consumer internet,‚Äù he said. G. E. has set an ambitious target for Predix. It hopes to attract $100 million in orders this year, on its way to $4 billion in revenue by 2020. By then, the company forecasts that its total digital business  ‚Äî   more than 90 percent of it software  ‚Äî   may reach as much as $15 billion, up from $6 billion now. For Predix to reach its potential, though, G. E. needs outside programmers to write software for it. The company, with its deep pockets, can start the   parade, but will others follow? This will be a major test. And G. E.‚Äôs campaign to build an industrial operating system and create a flourishing ecosystem of software for it is just getting underway in earnest. In late July, G. E. hosted a Predix conference in Las Vegas, which attracted 1, 200 software developers. Such developer gatherings are part of the playbook of every major software company but unusual for an industrial corporation. G. E. has some   advantages. Its installed base is huge. For example, the company says more than a third of the world‚Äôs electricity is generated on G. E. equipment. It can make progress simply by winning over the aircraft makers, oil companies, hospitals and utilities that now depend on G. E. machinery. G. E. is starting to attract a developer following. Tata Consultancy Services, for one, says it now has 500 programmers designing and developing Predix applications for customers in the   aviation and health care industries. G. E. also promotes partnerships with Infosys, Wipro and Capgemini to help business write Predix software. When he joined in 2011, Mr. Ruh had no illusions that making software a strength at a   company would be easy. At the time, he told Mr. Immelt that would be ‚Äúa   journey,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre in the middle of that journey. ‚Äù Part of that is an effort to change an engineering culture that stretches back generations. ‚ÄúIf G. E. is truly going to be a   company, we can‚Äôt be separate here,‚Äù Mr. Ruh said of his software division. Digital ‚Äútools and habits‚Äù need to be embedded ‚Äúin how people do their jobs,‚Äù he said. In its factory in Greenville, S. C. G. E. produces both giant power generators and evidence that this metamorphosis might work. The   building is crowded with immense cranes and milling, grinding and welding machines, overseen by manufacturing engineers and technicians. The finishing touches are being put on one of G. E.‚Äôs new gas turbines. It looks like the business end of a rocket ship lying on its side, a gleaming steel dynamo at rest. It weighs 950, 000 pounds. It fires up at nearly 2, 900 degrees Fahrenheit, and it can generate enough electricity to supply more than 500, 000 households. The gas turbine was brought to market in half the typical five years. That kind of accelerated product development is a performance that G. E. hopes to replicate across its industrial businesses. And it is a story of changes in design and manufacturing practices made possible by digital technology. John Lammas, the    vice president for power generation engineering, started his working career 40 years ago, on the shop floor of a   jet engine factory in Birmingham, England. He has been with G. E. for 31 years, moving up the ranks of the company‚Äôs jet engine and power turbine divisions. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm an old mechanical guy,‚Äù he said. But a couple of years ago, he issued an edict: no more paper drawings. In the past, a model of a new part would be made and then converted to detailed blueprints running to 70 pages or more. These would then be physically sent to G. E. manufacturing engineers and outside suppliers to begin setting up the tooling, casting and cutting for the part. This    routine took up to eight weeks. Now, engineers use   computer models, skip the prototype step and instantly send the models electronically. This goes a step beyond   design, which is commonplace. In Greenville, the designers are for the first time linked directly with manufacturers and suppliers in real time, in what G. E. calls a ‚Äúdigital thread. ‚Äù This means they can collaborate in ways that have changed the work process while making it more likely that problems or defects are spotted sooner. Traditionally, one set of engineers designed a part, and only then passed it on to manufacturing. If a problem arose on the supplier side, the design was kicked back and the process started over. ‚ÄúJobs are combining in this digital world,‚Äù Mr. Lammas said. Greenville‚Äôs own equipment has been a Predix guinea pig. The machinery and factory were retrofitted with   sensors and the software. Matt Krause, the plant manager, said that last winter, when a snowstorm shut the factory for a day, the sensor network detected that the plant had consumed 1, 000 pounds of argon, an inert gas used in coatings for parts. The leak was fixed, saving $350, 000 a year. ‚ÄúWe can see things we never did before,‚Äù Mr. Krause said. Over all, 60 of 200 steps in design and production have been automated or eliminated, reducing work time by 530, 000 hours over three years, G. E. estimates. Not all the   ideas that G. E. is trying to breed translate comfortably to heavy industry. Lean proponents urge companies to come up with ‚Äúminimum viable products,‚Äù particularly test versions of software programs. But no one wants a minimum viable jet engine or power generator. Yet in Greenville, engineers in the design stages are encouraged to move faster in smaller steps, conduct more experiments, and be willing to fail and try again. It amounts to a sea change in the engineering culture of heavy industry. ‚ÄúAs an engineer, not getting it right the first time, I find painful,‚Äù said Bill Byrne, an engineering manager. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs uncomfortable. But it‚Äôs been incredibly liberating. ‚Äù The old ways, said Mr. Lammas, the engineering chief, had merit. Each step and rule was logical on its own. But the emphasis on flawless execution and perfection fostered a fear of failure. ‚ÄúOvercoming that culture was probably the biggest challenge,‚Äù he said.",Foregin,
"How does a former senator . .. stateswoman . .. hoping to build a financial stockpile . .. find a way to make it worth her donors‚Äô while? ‚ÄúHamilton‚Äù tickets. At a special Tuesday matinee,   supporters of Hillary Clinton filed into the Richard Rodgers Theater for a special performance that was, in a rare turn, a touch more expensive than a typical show. But with seats available for $2, 700  ‚Äî   and status as ‚Äúevent chair‚Äù on offer for $100, 000  ‚Äî   the gathering, held for the Hillary Victory Fund, did include an uncommon guest: Mrs. Clinton, who took the stage after the final bows of a show she has now seen three times. ‚ÄúI cry every time,‚Äù she said, after embracing the show‚Äôs creator,   Miranda, who left his role as the title character over the weekend but returned on Tuesday to introduce her. Mrs. Clinton, who first attended last year off Broadway, at the Public Theater, took care to establish her ‚ÄúHamilton‚Äù bona fides, to a point. She neither rapped nor rhymed, but she alluded often to some of the show‚Äôs signature numbers. ‚ÄúAs Washington tells us, history‚Äôs eyes are on us,‚Äù she said at one point, invoking ‚ÄúHistory Has Its Eyes On You. ‚Äù ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs not throw away our shot,‚Äù she urged later, nodding to perhaps the show‚Äôs most famous song. The musical has become something of a bipartisan cause  ‚Äî   ‚Äúthe only thing,‚Äù President Obama has joked, ‚Äúthat Dick Cheney and I agree on. ‚Äù The president headlined a Democratic   last year at the theater. Mr. Miranda has his own political roots: His father, Luis A. Miranda Jr. is a longtime Democratic strategist in New York. The younger Mr. Miranda has, in recent months, urged Congress to assist Puerto Rico in its financial crisis. In his remarks, Mr. Miranda, his   Hamiltonian mane now shorn, made clear his preference for the November election, criticizing Donald J. Trump without saying his name. ‚ÄúAre you going to vote for the guy who wants to build a wall or for someone who‚Äôs building bridges?‚Äù asked Mr. Miranda, whose Tony   show is, after all, about an immigrant. He observed that the show had featured, or at least alluded to, the first four presidents. ‚ÄúRight now,‚Äù he said, ‚Äúyou‚Äôre going to hear from the 45th president. ‚Äù Mrs. Clinton, taking the stage to raucous cheers, hugged Mr. Miranda and thanked him for advocating on behalf of Puerto Rico and the families of victims of the massacre last month in Orlando. Speaking for about four minutes, Mrs. Clinton lingered on the message of the show‚Äôs final number, ‚ÄúWho Lives, Who Dies, Who Tells Your Story,‚Äù and the meaning of legacy. ‚ÄúIt really is true that it matters whose stories are told,‚Äù she said, ‚Äúand heard. ‚Äù",Foregin,

"Trump the Great
Paul Craig Roberts
Liberals, progressives, and the left-wing (to the extent that one still exists) are aligning with the corrupt oligarchy against president-elect Trump and the American people. 
They are busy at work trying to generate hysteria over Trump‚Äôs ‚Äúauthoritarian personality and followers.‚Äù In other words, the message is: here come the fascists.
Liberals and progressives wailed and whined about ‚Äúan all white male cabinet,‚Äù only to be made fools by Trump‚Äôs appointment of a black male and two women, one a minority and one a Trump critic.
The oligarchs are organizing their liberal progressive front groups to disrupt Trump‚Äôs inauguration in an effort to continue the attempt to delegitimize Trump the way the paid Maidan protesters were used in Kiev to delegitimize the elected Ukrainian government.
To the extent any of the Trump protesters are sincere and not merely paid tools of oligarchs, such as George Soros, military and financial interests, and global capitalists, they should consider that false claims and unjustified criticism can cause Trump and his supporters to close their ears to all criticism and make it easier for neoconservatives to influence Trump by offering support.
At this point we don‚Äôt know what a Trump government is going to do. If he sells out the people, he won‚Äôt be reelected. If he is defeated by the oligarchy, the people will become more radical. 
We do not know how Washington insiders appointed to the government will behave inside a Trump presidency. Unless they are ideologues like the neoconservatives or agents of powerful interests, insiders survive by going along with the current. If the current changes under Trump, so will the insiders. 
Trump got elected because flyover America has had all it can take from the self-dealing oligarchy. The vast bullk of America has seen its economic prospects and that of children and grandchildren decline for a quarter century. The states Hillary carried are limited to the liberal enclaves and oligarchy‚Äôs stomping grounds on the NE and West coasts and in Colorado and New Mexico, where effete wealthy liberals have located because of the scenary. If you look at the red/blue electoral map, geographically speaking Hillary‚Äôs support is very limited.
We know that Hillary is an agent for the One Percent. The Clintons $120 million personal wealth and $1.6 billion personal foundation are proof that the Clintons are bought-and-paid-for. We know that Hillary is responsible for the destruction of Libya and of much of Syria and for the overthrow of the democratically elected government in Ukraine. We know that the Clinton regime‚Äôs sanctions on Iraq resulted in the deaths of 500,000 children. These are war crimes and crimes against humanity. We know Hillary used government office for private gain. We know she violated national security laws without being held accountable. What we don‚Äôt know is why groups that allegedly are liberal-progressive-leftwing are such fervent supporters of Hillary.
One possible answer is that these groups are mere fronts for vested interests and are devoid of any sincere motives.
Another possible answer is that these groups believe that the important issues are not jobs for Americans and avoiding war with nuclear powers, but transgender, homosexual and illegal alien rights.
Another possible answer is that these groups are uninformed and stupid.
What these protesters see as a threat in Trump‚Äôs strong and willful personality is actually a virtue. A cipher like Obama has no more ability to stand up to the oligarchy than a disengaged George W. Bush so easily stage-managed by Dick Cheney. Nothing less than an authoritarian style and personality is a match for the well-entrenched ruling oligarchy and willful neoconservatives. If Trump were a shrinking violet, the electorate would have ignored him.
Trump did not purchase his presidency with the offer of handouts to blacks, the poor generally, teachers unions, farmers, abortion rights for women, etc. Trump was elected because he said: ‚ÄúThose who control the levers of power in Washington and the global special interests they partner with, don‚Äôt have your good in mind. It‚Äôs a global power structure that is responsible for the economic decisions that have robbed our working class, stripped our country of its wealth and put that money into the pockets of a handful of large corporations and political entities. The only thing that can stop this corrupt machine is you.‚Äù
It has been a long time since the electorate heard this kind of talk from someone seeking public office. Trump‚Äôs words are what Americans were waiting to hear.
As willful as Trump is, he is only one person. The oligarchy are many.
As impressive as Trump‚Äôs billion dollars is, the oligarchs have trillions.
Congress being in Republican hands will spare Trump partisan obstruction, but Congress remains in the hands of interest groups. 
As powerful as the office of the president can be, without unity in government changes from the top don‚Äôt occur, especially if the president is at odds with the military with regard to the alleged threat posed by Russia and China. Trump says he wants peace with the nuclear powers. The military/security complex needs an enemy for its budget.
It is absolutely necessary that a lid be put on tensions between nuclear powers and that economic opportunity reappears for the American people. Trump is not positioned to benefit from war and jobs offshoring. The only sensible strategy is to support him on these issues and to hold his feet to the fire.
As for the immigration issue, the Obama Justice (sic) Department has just worsened the picture with its ruling that American police departments cannot discriminate against non-citizens by only hiring citizens as officers. Now that US citizens face arrest in their own country by non-citizens, the resentment of immigrants will increase. Clearly it is nonsensical to devalue American citizenship in this way. Clearly it is sensible to put a lid on immigration until the US economy is again able to create jobs capable of sustaining an independent existence. 
If Trump can defeat the oligarchy and save America, he can go down in history as Trump the Great. I think that this prospect appeals to Trump more than more wealth. Instead of trying to tear him down in advance, he should be supported. With Trump‚Äôs determination and the people‚Äôs support, change from the top down is possible. Otherwise, change has to come from the bottom up, and that means an awful lot of blood in the streets.

Hillary Clinton thought her email scandal was in the rearview mirror, but it just blew up in her face days before the election. Unfortunately for her, everything just got worse as a bombshell just exploded ‚Äì and seeing how the topic is about prison, it looks like things are about to get juicy. 
There‚Äôs no doubt that Hillary is as crooked as they come. Although the left would have you believe otherwise, with the presidential hopeful all but admitting her criminal acts, not too many people believe them. 
However, things just got a lot worse for Hillary, but his time, it‚Äôs not only her presidential campaign that‚Äôs in jeopardy. According to The Economic Collapse , Hillary Clinton is looking at a whopping 20 years behind bars if she‚Äôs convicted of ‚Äúobstruction of justice‚Äù ‚Äì a term that could very well be a life sentence for a woman of her age. A sight we may get to see soon, and one that Hillary Clinton rightfully deserves 
As of this point, no one is mentioning the phrase ‚Äúobstruction of justice,‚Äù but that doesn‚Äôt mean the idea isn‚Äôt floating out there. In fact, when you look at the actual definition of the term in regards to the Federal statute, you start to get a better idea of just how guilty Hillary is: 
Whoever knowingly alters, destroys, mutilates, conceals, covers up, falsified, or makes a false entry in any record, document, or tangible object with the intent to impede, obstruct, or influence the investigation or proper administration of any matter within the jurisdiction of any department or agency of the United States or any case filed under Title 11, or in relation to or contemplation of any such matter or case, shall be fined under this title, imprisoned not more than 20 years, or both. 
We already know that Hillary is guilty of trying to cover this up. Not only did she delete and ‚Äúbleachbit‚Äù her server in a desperate attempt to block the FBI from finding out her dirty little secret, but then she said she didn‚Äôt have the emails they were looking for. 
Of course, when others stumbled across the mythical 33,000 emails, things started to take a turn ‚Äì and it all just got worse. According to The Wall Street Journal , the FBI now has another 650,000 emails to sort through with about 10,000 pertinent to Hillary‚Äôs case. Things aren‚Äôt looking so good for Hillary Clinton 
Why did FBI Director James Comey find the need to come forward with this information so close to the election? Well, as it turns out, the answer is rather simple ‚Äì redemption. 
According to a Daily Mail article written by Ed Klein, the author of a bestseller about the Clintons entitled Guilty As Sin , it seems as though Comey was suffering for letting off Hillary so easy. As explained by Klein: 
‚ÄúSome people, including department heads, stopped talking to Jim, and even ignored his greetings when they passed him in the hall,‚Äù said the source. ‚ÄòThey felt that he betrayed them and brought disgrace on the bureau by letting Hillary off with a slap on the wrist. He told his wife that he was depressed by the stack of resignation letters piling up on his desk from disaffected agents. The letters reminded him every day that morale in the FBI had hit rock bottom.‚Äù 
Further speculation pertaining to Comey‚Äôs reasoning seems to indicate that the urgency here stems from the information actually found. Knowing just how much the release would impact the election, one can only assume that Comey was only comfortable in doing so as someone had already found something really big. 
The fact of the matter is, people had lost faith in justice after Comey‚Äôs dismissal of Hillary‚Äôs charges. After proving that power meant exclusion from the law, it seems as though the FBI Director is trying to right that wrong today. Furthermore, as there seems to be something of substantive nature, Hillary can expect to be facing 20 years behind bars ‚Äì a sentence a great many people would feel is justified.",Foregin,
"Having booked their flights and secured their hotels, travelers often consider rental cars among the last of their   tasks, making the unprepared more vulnerable to the    of industry fees. ‚ÄúOur number one advice for renters is to do their homework,‚Äù said David Solomito, vice president of marketing for North America at Kayak. ‚ÄúFor most people, rental cars are the least considered part of trip. ‚Äù As technology has changed travel  ‚Äî   consider toll roads, which often do not have manned tollbooths any longer  ‚Äî   so it has the rules of the road when it comes to renting cars. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not dramatic in terms of what companies are charging in fees, it‚Äôs just that there‚Äôs more of them,‚Äù said Rick Garlick, who leads the global travel and hospitality practice at J. D. Power, which conducts consumer surveys, including an annual survey on car rental satisfaction (for the third year running, Enterprise has ranked highest). ‚ÄúAncillary fees, as with airlines, are how the companies retain profitability,‚Äù he said. There are a number of ways to save money on rental cars, including renting from a location that‚Äôs not at an airport, which Kayak says will save you an average of 11 percent. But there are several charges that tend to nip renters‚Äô wallets after they return their cars that can be avoided or reduced with a little forethought. Assuming you haven‚Äôt purchased any refueling options when you signed the contract, rental car agencies require renters to return the car with the same amount of gas as when they departed, which usually means full. But the mileage range between topping off the tank and reaching the return facility is a gray area. ‚ÄúAt Hertz, we do not have a mileage restriction. We simply ask that customers refuel to the same level they started with,‚Äù wrote Lauren Luster, communications manager with Hertz, in an email. This lack of definition is open to exploitation both from drivers who refuel miles away and from agencies. I recently returned a car to Avis in Miami after refueling a block from the airport return terminal, only to find a ‚Äúfuel service‚Äù charge of $16. 07 on my bill. An Avis employee redacted it when I objected. A spokeswoman for Avis said the company has about 40, 000 ‚Äúconnected‚Äù cars, which measure fuel levels when exiting and   the rental facility. ‚ÄúWe carefully monitor the system and work closely with car manufacturers, so the likelihood that the technology in the vehicle malfunctioned is slim,‚Äù wrote Alice Pereira, an Avis spokeswoman, in an email. Industry experts advise making a mental note of the closest gas station when you drive away from the rental facility. ‚ÄúCars aren‚Äôt getting smarter, we need to be,‚Äù said Lauren Fix, an author and automotive writer also known as the Car Coach. ‚ÄúIf you have a receipt to prove you refilled, they will usually refund the fee. Any pushback, I ask for a manager. ‚Äù Drivers are responsible for paying their own tolls, but a shift to electronic tolling has made it harder for renters to avoid the fees charged by agencies as manned booths have disappeared from many routes. Most agencies provide electronic transponders that allow convenient access to toll roads. But once they are triggered by a tollgate, the devices initiate a daily rental fee, often regardless of whether it is used each day. These fees are in addition to the actual tolls, so that while you may only incur a few dollars in tolls driving from Miami to Key West, you will pay somewhere between $2. 95 a day for the device at Payless Car Rental to $4. 95 a day with Hertz. These fees are usually capped. Avis charges a maximum of $19. 75 per rental month Hertz charges $24. 75 maximum per rental agreement and Payless charges $14. 75 maximum for each rental period. Enterprise, National and Alamo car rentals offer the use of automatic tolling for $3. 95 per day it is used, with a maximum charge of $19. 75 for the rental term. Car rental companies stress that drivers can pay cash (when the option exists) avoid toll roads or bring their own electronic transponders from home. Not all electronic passes are linked, however. The   can be used in most Northeastern and   states and a few in the Midwest, extending from Maine down to North Carolina and west to Illinois. An   may be used in various vehicles as long as they are in the same class as your car, so forget using it if you rent a  . Some toll roads in California will allow drivers to register a credit card to the rental car license plate and have the tolls charged automatically. Many consumers assume that an early rental return will spare them the fee remaining for the balance of the contract. That doesn‚Äôt take into account the lost revenue that the rental car company incurs. ‚ÄúIt messes with their inventory and planning,‚Äù said Mr. Solomito of Kayak. ‚ÄúReturning a car early is considered breaking the contract. ‚Äù How early is early depends on the company, but generally anything less than 24 hours before the return date requires payment of the full amount. If earlier, Dollar Rent A Car, for example, will only charge for the days used and add a $25 charge, according to the company website, ‚Äúto compensate us in part for our inability to rent your vehicle during the remaining time we have reserved for your use. ‚Äù Late returns generally trigger fees. And like airline rebooking, any changes may result in a different rate than the one originally agreed to. Hertz encourages customers to call its Rental Extensions department. They may be subject to a $10   fee, through renters can avoid the fee if they change a return date when they pick up the car. If they don‚Äôt call, however, they can be subject to a fee of $12 a day, up to a maximum of $60, in addition to daily rental charges. Parking or traffic tickets are the driver‚Äôs responsibility. But if ever there were a financial incentive to driving carefully, it‚Äôs in a rental car, where ticket fees may come with a service charge from the rental company. These penalties are usually detailed in the terms and conditions of the rental contract. Avis‚Äôs contract says offenses will be charged back to the renter‚Äôs credit card, and the company may impose a $30 administration fee to cover the cost of notifying the renter of the infraction by sending copies of the notices. Payless charges a $50 fee per violation. ‚ÄúWhat the big print giveth, the little print taketh away,‚Äù Ms. Fix said. ‚ÄúYou have to be aware. ‚Äù",Foregin,
"WASHINGTON  ‚Äî   Was the impeachment of Dilma Rousseff as the president of Brazil on Wednesday a coup? Technically, the answer is no. Although there is no single definition of what constitutes a coup, it is at its core an illegal seizure of power. The Brazilian Senate‚Äôs    vote to remove Ms. Rousseff was the culmination of a legal process set forth in the Brazilian Constitution, and it simply does not meet that standard. But Ms. Rousseff and her supporters have argued for months that the effort to oust her was in fact a coup engineered by a small group of elites. They are not bothered by strict legal definitions. Rather, ‚Äúcoup‚Äù has become shorthand for accusing Ms. Rousseff‚Äôs political opponents of exploiting the law to subvert democracy. There is truth to that. But it is rooted in problems that afflict Brazil‚Äôs entire political system, not just its right or its left. Any opposition party anywhere stands to gain from the downfall of the governing party‚Äôs leader. In Brazil, that was heightened by the fact that members of the opposition had been caught up in a major corruption scandal. Romero Juc√°, an influential opposition legislator who had been implicated in the scandal, was recorded in March saying of the investigation, ‚ÄúWe have to change the government to be able to stop this bleeding. ‚Äù Ms. Rousseff was impeached on what analysts near universally described as minor charges: concealing a budget deficit by borrowing from a   bank  ‚Äî   illegal, but not a criminal offense. Amy Erica Smith, an assistant political science professor at Iowa State University who studies Brazil, said these charges ‚Äúdon‚Äôt rise to the level of the kind of accusations that would merit impeachment,‚Äù adding: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not a legitimate use of the impeachment proceedings. ‚Äù This is why Ms. Rousseff and her allies argued that the politicians pushing impeachment were not trying to protect the integrity of Brazilian democracy, but, rather, to manipulate it to serve their own ends. Calling the impeachment a coup became a way to question the motives of opposition leaders and to argue that impeaching Ms. Rousseff would be contrary to democracy. Normally, following the law  ‚Äî   which the impeachers were indeed doing  ‚Äî   by design serves democracy. But, in Brazil, there is currently just enough corruption and just enough rule of law for political elites to play the two against each other. Corruption, Professor Smith explained, is so endemic in Brazilian politics that it most likely implicates the entire governing class. The country also has a powerful judiciary that is actively working to investigate and prosecute corruption  ‚Äî   an unstable combination. This gives political elites both a means and an incentive to expose their rivals, knowing it will probably ruin them. After all, if everyone is corrupt, everyone is vulnerable. But while that serves individual politicians, it weakens the wider political system by introducing instability. And because Brazil‚Äôs economy is doing so poorly, the public is, understandably, angry at the government and eager to see corruption punished. So while Ms. Rousseff‚Äôs supporters might see this impeachment as a cynical ploy, her opponents see a symbolic blow against a corrupt system  ‚Äî   even if that corruption extends across party lines. There is also an important class dimension playing out. Ms. Rousseff led the   Workers Party, which positions itself as a champion of the poor. The opposition Party of the Brazilian Democratic Movement, which pushed for Ms. Rousseff‚Äôs ouster and took power after she was suspended from office in May, is seen as a champion of business interests. In the eyes of Workers Party devotees, the impeachment proceedings had an element of class warfare, with the elite seizing power to protect their interests  ‚Äî   which, to the other side, looks and feels like a coup even if it does not meet the formal definition. That perception was captured by a photograph, which went viral on social media, of a   couple in a wealthy neighborhood walking to a protest against President Rousseff in March while their maid pushed their children in a stroller alongside them. ‚ÄúWhen people talk about ‚Äòcoup mongers,‚Äô ‚Äù said Professor Smith, ‚Äúthey‚Äôre often implicitly thinking about, you know, a rich white woman who is upset that her maid now is entitled to labor protections that limit what this rich white woman can ask her maid to do. ‚Äù But this view, promoted by Ms. Rousseff‚Äôs staunchest supports, is something of a caricature. An April poll by the firm Datafolha found that 61 percent of Brazilians supported holding impeachment proceedings against Ms. Rousseff, and that her approval rating was a scant 13 percent. . So it is not the case, as some have argued, that Ms. Rousseff‚Äôs impeachment was a coup in the sense that a handful of elites subverted the popular will. Nor have they, in these proceedings, gone outside the law. Rather, Ms. Rousseff‚Äôs political opponents have done something subtler: They exploited the popular will and the letter of the law to serve their own interests, rather than the interests of democracy. Of course, in all countries, politicians act out of  . And impeachment proceedings are always political  ‚Äî   something that any American who lived through President Bill Clinton‚Äôs impeachment hearings can tell you. But the particular nature of Brazil‚Äôs system at this moment makes its politics particularly unstable, and gives individual politicians greater power to leverage democracy toward ends that are not so democratic.",Foregin,
"  Donald J. Trump on Tuesday tempered some of his most extreme campaign promises, dropping his vow to jail Hillary Clinton, expressing doubt about the value of torturing terrorism suspects and pledging to have an open mind about climate change. But in a   hourlong interview with reporters and editors at The New York Times  ‚Äî   which was scheduled, canceled and then reinstated after a dispute over the ground rules  ‚Äî   Mr. Trump was unapologetic about flouting some of the traditional ethical and political conventions that have long shaped the American presidency. He said he had no legal obligation to establish boundaries between his business empire and his White House, conceding that the Trump brand ‚Äúis certainly a hotter brand than it was before. ‚Äù Still, he said he would try to figure out a way to insulate himself from his businesses, which would be run by his children. He defended Stephen K. Bannon, his chief strategist, against charges of racism, calling him a ‚Äúdecent guy. ‚Äù And he mocked Republicans who had failed to support him in his unorthodox presidential campaign. In the midday meeting in the   boardroom of The Times‚Äôs publisher, Arthur Sulzberger Jr. Mr. Trump seemed confident even as he said he was awed by his new job. ‚ÄúIt is a very overwhelming job, but I‚Äôm not overwhelmed by it,‚Äù he said. He displayed a jumble of impulses, many of them conflicting. He was magnanimous toward Mrs. Clinton, but boastful about his victory. He was   about some of his positions, uncompromising about others. The interview demonstrated the volatility in Mr. Trump‚Äôs positions. He said he had no interest in pressing for Mrs. Clinton‚Äôs prosecution over her use of a private email server or for financial acts committed by the Clinton Foundation. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to hurt the Clintons, I really don‚Äôt,‚Äù he said. On the issue of torture, Mr. Trump suggested he had changed his mind about the value of waterboarding after talking with James N. Mattis, a retired Marine Corps general, who headed the United States Central Command. ‚ÄúHe said, ‚ÄòI‚Äôve never found it to be useful,‚Äô‚Äù Mr. Trump said. He added that Mr. Mattis found more value in building trust and rewarding cooperation with terrorism suspects: ‚Äú‚ÄòGive me a pack of cigarettes and a couple of beers, and I‚Äôll do better. ‚Äô‚Äù ‚ÄúI was very impressed by that answer,‚Äù Mr. Trump said. Torture, he said, is ‚Äúnot going to make the kind of a difference that a lot of people are thinking. ‚Äù Mr. Trump repeated that Mr. Mattis was being ‚Äúseriously, seriously considered‚Äù to be secretary of defense. ‚ÄúI think it‚Äôs time, maybe, for a general,‚Äù he said. On climate change, Mr. Trump refused to repeat his promise to abandon the international climate accord reached last year in Paris, saying, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm looking at it very closely. ‚Äù Despite the recent appointment to his transition team of a fierce critic of the Paris accords, Mr. Trump said that ‚ÄúI have an open mind to it‚Äù and that clean air and ‚Äúcrystal clear water‚Äù were vitally important. He held out assurances that he did not intend to embrace extremist positions in some areas. He vigorously denounced a white nationalist conference last weekend in Washington, where attendees gave the Nazi salute and criticized Jews. Asked about his antagonism with the news media and his vow to toughen libel laws, Mr. Trump offered no specifics but told the group, ‚ÄúI think you‚Äôll be happy. ‚Äù Despite his frequent attacks against what he has dubbed the ‚Äúfailing New York Times,‚Äù Mr. Trump seemed to go out of his way to praise the institution, which he called ‚Äúa great, great American jewel, world jewel. ‚Äù He did, however, say he believed The Times had been too tough on him during the campaign. Pressed to respond to criticism in other areas, he was defiant. He declared that ‚Äúthe law‚Äôs totally on my side‚Äù when it comes to questions about conflict of interest and ethics laws. ‚ÄúThe president can‚Äôt have a conflict of interest,‚Äù he said. He said it would be extremely difficult to sell off his businesses because they are real estate holdings. He said that he would ‚Äúlike to do something‚Äù and create some kind of arrangement to separate his businesses from his work in government. He noted that he had turned over the management of his businesses to his children, which ethics lawyers say is not sufficient to prevent conflicts of interest. He insisted that he could still invite business partners into the White House for    photographs. He said that critics were pressuring him to go beyond what he was willing to do, including distancing himself from his children while they run his businesses. ‚ÄúIf it were up to some people,‚Äù he said, ‚ÄúI would never, ever see my daughter Ivanka again. ‚Äù Mr. Trump did not dispute reports that he had used a meeting last week with Nigel Farage, the U. K. Independence Party leader, to raise his opposition to offshore wind farms. Mr. Trump has long complained that wind farms would mar the view from his golf course in Aberdeenshire, Scotland. ‚ÄúI might have brought it up,‚Äù Mr. Trump said, then argued he had done so because of policy concerns about wind farms rather than any personal interest. Mr. Trump rejected the idea that he was bound by federal antinepotism laws from installing his    Jared Kushner, in a White House job. But he said he would want to avoid the appearance of a conflict and might instead seek to make Mr. Kushner a special envoy charged with brokering peace in the Middle East. ‚ÄúThe president of the United States is allowed to have whatever conflicts he or she wants, but I don‚Äôt want to do that,‚Äù Mr. Trump said. But he said that Mr. Kushner, who is an observant Jew, ‚Äúcould be very helpful‚Äù in reconciling the longstanding dispute between the Israelis and the Palestinians. ‚ÄúI would love to be able to be the one that made peace with Israel and the Palestinians,‚Äù Mr. Trump said, adding that Mr. Kushner ‚Äúwould be very good at it‚Äù and that ‚Äúhe knows the region. ‚Äù ‚ÄúA lot of people tell me, really great people tell me, that it‚Äôs impossible  ‚Äî   you can‚Äôt do it,‚Äù Mr. Trump added. ‚ÄúI disagree. I think you can make peace. ‚Äù ‚ÄúI have reason to believe I can do it,‚Äù he added. Mr. Trump spoke only in general terms about foreign policy. He said the United States should not ‚Äúbe a nation builder,‚Äù repeated his line from the campaign that fighting the war in Iraq was ‚Äúone of the great mistakes in the history of our country,‚Äù and said he has some ‚Äúvery definitive‚Äù and ‚Äústrong ideas‚Äù about how to deal with the violent civil war raging in Syria. He declined to say what those ideas are despite several requests to do so. ‚ÄúWe have to end that craziness that‚Äôs going on in Syria,‚Äù he said. The   said that he had talked with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia since winning the election, but he did not elaborate. He said it would be ‚Äúnice‚Äù if he and Mr. Putin could get along, but he rejected the idea that any warming of relations would be called a ‚Äúreset,‚Äù noting the criticism that Mrs. Clinton received after her attempts at bettering relations between the countries failed. ‚ÄúI wouldn‚Äôt use that term after what happened,‚Äù Mr. Trump said. Mr. Trump made a forceful defense of Mr. Bannon, whom he named as his chief strategist and who has drawn charges of racism and  . This summer, Mr. Bannon called Breitbart News, the website he led, ‚Äúthe platform for the ‚Äù a white nationalist movement. Mr. Trump said Mr. Bannon had been dismayed at the reaction to his hiring. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve known Steve Bannon a long time. If I thought he was a racist or ‚Äù he said, ‚ÄúI wouldn‚Äôt even think about hiring him. ‚Äù Mr. Trump added: ‚ÄúI think he‚Äôs having a hard time with it because it‚Äôs not him. I think he‚Äôs been treated very unfairly. ‚Äù He also defended Breitbart, which has carried racist and   content, saying it was no different from The Times, only ‚Äúmuch more conservative. ‚Äù Mr. Trump said he hoped to develop a ‚Äúgreat   relationship‚Äù with President Obama, with whom he said he had an unexpected rapport. ‚ÄúI really liked him a lot, and I am a little bit surprised that I am telling you that I really liked him a lot,‚Äù he said. And Mr. Trump gloated about defying the polls and the expectations of his own party to win the presidency, and boasted of how he had taken his revenge on Republicans who kept him at a distance and then lost their own races. He said that one of them, Senator Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire, would ‚Äúlove to have a job in the administration. ‚Äù ‚ÄúI said, ‚ÄòNo, thank you,‚Äô‚Äù Mr. Trump said of Ms. Ayotte, who lost her Senate seat to Gov. Maggie Hassan of New Hampshire. ‚ÄúShe refused to vote for me. ‚Äù He also criticized Representative Joe Heck of Nevada, who vacillated over supporting Mr. Trump after an    recording surfaced in which Mr. Trump bragged in lewd terms about grabbing women without their consent. ‚ÄúHe went down like a lead balloon,‚Äù Mr. Trump said of Mr. Heck. ‚ÄúI said, ‚ÄòOff the record, I hope you lose. ‚Äô‚Äù He said Republican leaders felt indebted to him for his surprise victory. ‚ÄúRight now,‚Äù Mr. Trump said, ‚Äúthey‚Äôre in love with me. ‚Äù",Foregin,
"Stephanie Danler‚Äôs first novel, ‚ÄúSweetbitter,‚Äù about a young woman in New York City‚Äôs restaurant world, is going to make a lot of people hungry. It did me, at any rate. My copy, I notice, has some grease stains in it, a few red pepper flakes, a stubby bit of mint. ‚ÄúSweetbitter‚Äù will be consumed with special avidity by young food people  ‚Äî   sommeliers, cheesemakers, sous chefs, managers, pastry wizards  ‚Äî   who dream of making it in the big city, or at least of making it by   standards. It‚Äôs an unpretentious,     novel  ‚Äî   bought by Knopf  in an     deal  ‚Äî   that reads like a letter home from a   friend. In this case, that friend is named Tess, like Thomas Hardy‚Äôs heroine and Melanie Griffith‚Äôs striving secretary in ‚ÄúWorking Girl. ‚Äù This Tess is 22 when she escapes her unnamed hometown and its ‚Äútwin pillars of football and church‚Äù and drives into Manhattan. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs say I was born in late June of 2006 when I came over the George Washington Bridge at 7 a. m.,‚Äù she says, ‚Äúwith the sun circulating and dawning, the sky full of sharp corners of light, before the exhaust rose, before the heat gridlocked in, windows unrolled, radio turned up to some impossibly hopeful pop song, open, open, open. ‚Äù Thanks to her poise and friendly good looks, Tess finds a job as an apprentice server at a restaurant that‚Äôs clearly modeled after Union Square Cafe, one of Manhattan‚Äôs best. (The author has worked at Union Square Cafe and at another cheerful restaurant, Buvette.) She finds a scuzzy apartment in a cheap section of Williamsburg, Brooklyn. Tess falls deeply into her work and feels the city begin to unfold for her. Ms. Danler is a sensitive observer of the almost wartime camaraderie among workers at a restaurant that‚Äôs humming at full capacity, of the exhaustion, of the postshift drinking in dive bars until dawn, of the sex and other stimulants  ‚Äî   the biggest one simply being young and alive and open to the animal and intellectual possibilities that New York offers. Once upon a time, this sort of aspirational, young person‚Äôs novel was written about writers and artists. Food workers are climbing the status ladder. Now these novels are about chefs or even, in this case, servers. This book has an onrushing ‚ÄúBright Lights, Big City‚Äù vibe and falls into an emerging genre you might call Bright Lights, Small Plates. A restaurant, like a platoon in a war novel, allows a writer to deploy a large cast with relative ease. In ‚ÄúSweetbitter‚Äù we meet a handsome if   young bartender (‚ÄúHe drank like he was the only person who understood beer‚Äù) an enigmatic female head server who is Tess‚Äôs mentor and tormentor a harried chef a manager who does more than ogle his favorite female employees. None feel like stereotypes. A subtle sense of melancholy hangs over these men and women. They‚Äôre happy to be where they are in fact, they feel chosen. But they‚Äôre nearly all here because of other dreams that were thwarted. They‚Äôre failed poets or academics. Tess had hoped to be a photographer. ‚ÄúSweetbitter‚Äù is the story of Tess‚Äôs sentimental education. We don‚Äôt learn much about her past. But in Manhattan we watch her  ‚Äî   she is vulnerable but rarely weak  ‚Äî   pour herself full with books and art and music, and blossom like a daisy. Mostly she fills herself with lovely things to eat and drink. Tess isn‚Äôt a hipster (‚ÄúI cared too much about the wrong things‚Äù). And Ms. Danler isn‚Äôt another Anthony Bourdain manqu√©, delivering a caustic expos√©. She takes the reader by the hand as Tess learns dozens of lessons, from distinguishing among varieties of oysters, types of winter lettuce and appellations of Burgundy to opening wine properly to appreciating a pig‚Äôs head terrine. Tess knows she will, at some point, want more than this. But for now this punishing life feels like ravishment. When a college acquaintance comes into the restaurant one night and condescends to her, only politeness prevents her from speaking aloud: ‚ÄúI chose this life because it‚Äôs a constant assault of color and taste and light and it‚Äôs raw and ugly and fast and it‚Äôs mine. And you‚Äôll never understand. Until you live it, you don‚Äôt know. ‚Äù This novel, which reads a bit like a food world version of Curtis Sittenfeld‚Äôs ‚ÄúPrep,‚Äù gets off to a bad start. You notice that its four sections are named after the seasons, as if they were George Winston albums. At the beginning there are gimmicky interpolated sections about things like the nature of sweet versus sour. You fear you may be headed into a genre fiction tunnel of love. Those fears are quickly dispelled. Ms. Danler is a gifted commenter (chilly autumn air in Manhattan ‚Äútasted of steel knives and filtered water‚Äù) on many things, class especially. An awareness of privilege runs through this novel like a tendon. ‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre good at this job,‚Äù she asks, ‚Äúwhat exactly are you good at?‚Äù ‚ÄúSweetbitter‚Äù grows darker than you might expect, in terms of where Tess‚Äôs desires lead her. It‚Äôs a book about hunger of every variety, even the sort that can disturb you and make you sometimes ask yourself, as does Tess, ‚ÄúWas I a monster or was this what it felt like to be a person?‚Äù",Foregin,
"GLENDALE, Ariz.  ‚Äî   Mark Few wrote the introduction for a book by his college roommate about the power of perseverance. On Saturday night, the Gonzaga men‚Äôs basketball team, which Few has built from a midmajor curiosity into a championship contender, provided him with material for a postscript. Gonzaga, making its 19th consecutive N. C. A. A. tournament appearance but its first trip to the Final Four, advanced to the national championship game with a   victory over South Carolina at University of Phoenix Stadium. In the final on Monday night, the Bulldogs will face a fellow No. 1 seed, North Carolina, which beat Oregon by   later on Saturday. Nigel   a junior guard, contributed 23 points, 6 assists and 5 rebounds, and his freshman roommate, Zach Collins, added 14 points and 13 rebounds for Gonzaga, a program that thrust itself into the national consciousness by reaching the round of 8 in 1999  ‚Äî   but until this season had never gotten any further. This season, the Bulldogs ( ) spent four weeks at No. 1 in the national polls before being dealt their only loss, to Brigham Young, in their final game of the regular season. On Saturday night, they could barely contain their excitement at the opportunity they had given themselves to be unequivocally known as college basketball‚Äôs best. Few, who is known for his   demeanor, was so overcome with emotion that he executed a handstand in the locker room. ‚ÄúI felt like I stuck it,‚Äù he said with a laugh, adding: ‚ÄúSometimes I worry that my guys get like, it‚Äôs a job. And we‚Äôve been on them to show emotion. So that‚Äôs my fairly weak effort of showing emotion. ‚Äù South Carolina ( ) a seventh seed that had defied all expectation to get so far, was also making its first trip to the Final Four. The Gamecocks were led by Chris Silva, who had 13 points and 13 rebounds. Sindarius Thornwell, a senior guard who had not scored fewer than 24 points in a tournament game this year, was held to a relatively quiet 15. ‚ÄúWe played our hearts out the way we did all year,‚Äù the senior Justin McKie said, ‚Äúand Gonzaga played a great game. ‚Äù It was just a matter of patience. In his book, ‚ÄúWater the Bamboo,‚Äù Few‚Äôs college roommate, Greg Bell, used the plant as a metaphor for success. Even with regular watering, giant timber bamboo does not appear to make any gains for the first three years of its life. But then, suddenly, it will sprout 90 feet in just two months. It took the Bulldogs considerably longer to reach their newfound height, but that only made Saturday‚Äôs result all the sweeter. Few‚Äôs South Carolina counterpart, Frank Martin, overcame a hardscrabble childhood to build a successful career in coaching, and his tailored suits cannot hide his rough edges. His intensity, embodied by his icy sideline stare, has rubbed off on his players. After   the Gonzaga players gathered in a circle, and as they were breaking apart, a few South Carolina players sauntered through the huddle, bumping a few of the Bulldogs as they passed. Then, before the opening tip, Gonzaga center Przemek Karnowski approached Thornwell, one senior to another, and extended his hand. Thornwell, the Gamecocks‚Äô leading scorer, brushed past him, leaving Karnowski to stare quizzically at Thornwell‚Äôs back and shrug. ‚ÄúMaybe that‚Äôs how he is,‚Äù Karnowski said after the game. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt really know him personally. ‚Äù Karnowski was happy to be on the floor at all. He missed most of last season with a   injury that required surgery. At 7 feet 1 inch and 300 pounds, Karnowski had four inches and more than 70 pounds on Silva, the sophomore forward from Gabon who was given the gargantuan task of guarding him under the basket. Fourteen minutes into the game, Silva rose to block Karnowski‚Äôs shot and made contact with Karnowski, who fell to the floor like a   Douglas fir. No foul was called, and while he writhed in pain, the Gamecocks pushed the ball up the court, with P. J. Dozier feeding McKie for a   that tied the score at  . Karnowski was helped to the sideline with a sore right elbow and a poked right eye, leaving Gonzaga, which had by then gotten 6 points and 4 rebounds from him, with a hole in the middle. Collins, a   freshman forward, filled it immediately. He contributed three rebounds, including two on the defensive end, to go with 2 points and a blocked shot in a frenetic stretch over the next 2 minutes 30 seconds to help Gonzaga to a   halftime lead. By then, Karnowski was already in the locker room. He could not open his right eye. But those missed games from last season were enough for him. He was back in the lineup at the start of the second half. ‚ÄúThe doctor said I‚Äôm good to go, so I was just real happy about it,‚Äù he said. Twice in the tournament, South Carolina had stormed back from halftime deficits, and it would be no different against Gonzaga. The first two times, Thornwell was the spark. This time it was Silva who led the charge as the Gamecocks tied the game at   and then took the lead on two free throws by Rakym Felder. ‚ÄúThat just showed the heart of a lion,‚Äù Few said, adding, ‚ÄúIt took everything we had to hold on and come back. ‚Äù Cultivated though it has been, Gonzaga‚Äôs offense did have to deal with a dry spell. The Bulldogs stalled when Karnowski‚Äôs teammates tried too often to force the ball inside to him, leading to turnovers that the Gamecocks turned into points at the other end. But it was a storm the Bulldogs could weather. Karnowski had 7 points in the second half to finish with 13. His understudy, Collins, had a sensational second half, with 6 points, 7 rebounds and 5 blocked shots. ‚ÄúWe did a really good job, I thought, of just sticking together,‚Äù Karnowski said. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs what we did the entire season. We don‚Äôt have 37 wins for nothing. ‚Äù As Few and a handful of his players made their way up the steps to the   dais, the moderator announced, ‚ÄúGonzaga has arrived. ‚Äù It just took longer than perhaps Few would have expected. ‚ÄúTo be playing the last game of the year is crazy cool,‚Äù he said.",Foregin,

"  Thank You FBI: The Clinton Email Investigation Has Shifted The Poll Numbers Significantly In Trump‚Äôs Favor   31st, 2016 
Donald Trump has all the momentum now. Will it be enough to propel him to victory on election day? Trump‚Äôs poll numbers were improving even before we learned that the FBI had   and the new survey results that came out over the weekend and on Monday make it clear that Clinton‚Äôs ‚Äúcertain victory‚Äù is not so certain after all. Unless something changes, Americans are going to go to the polls on November 8th with an FBI criminal investigation hanging over the Clinton campaign like an ominous cloud, and that is very good news for Trump. 
The Clinton campaign was hoping that this renewed investigation would not ‚Äúmove the needle‚Äù, but unfortunately for them that appears not to be the case. Hillary‚Äôs unfavorable rating just hit an all-time high , a whopping 45 percent of all Americans believe that this scandal is ‚Äúworse than Watergate‚Äù, and a Rasmussen survey has found that 40 percent of all undecided voters that are leaning toward voting for Hillary Clinton are still open to changing their minds   
And even before this story broke on Friday, Clinton was having a difficult time getting her voters to the polls. According to the New York Times , early voting among young adults and African-American voters is significantly down compared to 2012, and those are demographic groups that Clinton desperately needs to turn out in large numbers. 
But of course the key to winning the election is getting to 270 electoral votes, and poll numbers appear to be shifting in the key swing states that Trump and Clinton both desperately need. For a moment, I would like to examine what the numbers currently look like in some of the most important states‚Ä¶ 
Florida 
Without Florida, Donald Trump has absolutely no chance of winning. This is something that even the Trump campaign has admitted. That is why it was so alarming that most of the polls in October had Hillary Clinton leading in the state. 
Fortunately for Trump, a new survey that was conducted on Sunday shows him leading in Florida by four points . 
Georgia 
Georgia wasn‚Äôt supposed to be a problem. Georgia has traditionally been a deep red state, but polling throughout this election season had shown a very tight race. This had Republicans deeply concerned and the Clinton camp very happy. 
But now the momentum has seemingly shifted and the latest poll has Trump up by seven points . 
North Carolina 
Mitt Romney won North Carolina in 2012, and Donald Trump very much needs to win it if he hopes to be triumphant on November 8th. Hillary Clinton was shown to be leading in the eight most recent polls before the email story broke, but in the first major survey conducted afterwards she is now down by two points . 
Ohio 
No Republican has ever won the presidency without Ohio, and Trump knows how important it is to his chances. The three most recent polls conducted before the FBI renewed the investigation into Hillary Clinton‚Äôs emails all showed a tie, but now the very first survey conducted afterwards shows Trump up by five points . 
Colorado 
Hillary Clinton has consistently been in the lead in Colorado throughout this campaign, and most experts didn‚Äôt give Trump much of a chance in the state, but the latest survey shows that Clinton‚Äôs lead has been whittled down to just one point . 
Arizona 
A survey that was conducted in mid-October showed Clinton having a five point lead in John McCain‚Äôs home state, but now the latest major poll has Trump up by two points . 
Nevada 
One of the most important swing states out west is Nevada, and most surveys showed Hillary Clinton with a strong lead throughout the month of October. Unfortunately for her, a poll that was conducted on Sunday shows Donald Trump with a four point lead . 
Clearly Trump has the momentum at this point, and it will be very interesting to see how the numbers change over the next few days. 
And as we learn more about what is in these newly discovered emails, will her fellow Democrats stick with her? Already, some are publicly wavering. The following example comes from WND ‚Ä¶ 
Longtime Clinton confidante and former Democratic pollster Doug Schoen told Fox News the newly renewed FBI investigation into Hillary Clinton‚Äôs private email server is forcing him to ‚Äúreassess‚Äù his support for the Democratic nominee for president. 
Schoen, a Fox News contributor, made the comments to host Harris Faulkner during a live television appearance Sunday night on ‚ÄúFox Report Weekend.‚Äù 
Public opinion is shifting quickly, but the bad news for Trump is that more than 23 million Americans have already voted. So millions upon millions of Americans cast their votes before they even learned of this new FBI investigation. If the race is very close, that could end up making the difference. 
And of course the race could dramatically change once again if the FBI comes to some sort of resolution about these new emails prior to November 8th. On Monday, CNN reported that a resolution before election day did not appear to be likely‚Ä¶ 
FBI officials are unlikely to finish their review of new emails potentially related to its investigation into Hillary Clinton‚Äôs private server before the November 8 election. 
The initial work of cataloging top Clinton aide Huma Abedin‚Äôs emails found on her estranged husband Anthony Weiner‚Äôs laptop could be done in the next few days, US   told CNN. 
But the investigators are expected to spend more time doing other work, including likely working with other federal agencies to determine what ‚Äî if any ‚Äî classified materials are in the emails. This makes it unlikely there will be a resolution prior to the election. 
However, late on Monday evening the Drudge Report reported that the L.A. Times has learned that investigators may have a ‚Äúpreliminary assessment‚Äù completed ‚Äúin coming days‚Äù‚Ä¶ 
LA TIMES TUESDAY: FBI Investigators had planned to conduct new email review over several weeks. It now hopes to complete ‚Äòpreliminary assessment‚Äô in coming days, but agency officials have not decided how, or whether, they will disclose results publicly‚Ä¶ Developing‚Ä¶ 
Whether good or bad, I do believe that the American people deserve to hear something conclusive about these emails before November 8th. 
If nothing is found to implicate Clinton, the American people should be told that. 
And if evidence of very serious crimes is discovered, there is no way in the world that should be held back until after the election. 
Even if it throws the election into complete and utter chaos , the American people deserve to know the truth. 
But will we get it? 
Stay tuned, because I think that this is going to be a crazy week.",Foregin,
"Francis Wilkinson, Bloomberg, November 1, 2016 
The class compositions of the Republican and Democratic parties keep evolving. {snip} 
A Pew Research Center report last month detailed the shift. 
Since 1992, the share of Democratic and Democratic-leaning registered voters with at least a college degree has increased sharply, from 21 percent to 37 percent. Among Republicans, 31 percent have at least a college degree, up only slightly from 28 percent in 1992. As a consequence, a greater proportion of Democrats than Republicans now have a college degree or more education. 
In the New York Times last week, political sage Thomas Edsall called this process the ‚ÄúGreat Democratic Inversion.‚Äù 
What these figures suggest is that the 2016 election will represent a complete inversion of the New Deal order among white voters. From the 1930s into the 1980s and early 1990s, majorities of downscale whites voted Democratic and upscale whites voted Republican. Now, looking at combined male and female vote totals, the opposite is true. 
A key word in Edsall‚Äôs analysis is ‚Äúwhite.‚Äù Stories about the disaffected working-class supporters of Donald Trump apply almost exclusively to white voters. Other working-class voters‚Äìblacks and Hispanics ‚Äìare poised to provide lopsided support to Hillary Clinton. 
{snip} 
There is no expansive, working-class rage in the U.S. There is white conservative rage (along with a more modest left-wing version). While it may burn brightest in deindustrialized America, conservative rage extends across class and educational demarcations, from blue collars to billionaires . 
This complicates the story of the parties switching class allegiances. For Democrats, it leaves them managing an increasingly unwieldy coalition extending from white cosmopolitan millionaires who send their kids to private schools to low-paid Hispanic service workers and black factory and office workers facing economic dislocation. {snip} 
Keeping that coalition pointed in the same general direction might be impossible without the dedicated efforts of the Republican Party. The GOP has proved incapable of breaking out of its racial straitjacket. So it has opted instead to tighten the straps around its torso. 
{snip} 
Republicans‚Äô constant struggle with racism in their ranks, and their recurring failure to resist the temptation to exploit it, eases pressure on the Democrats‚Äô sprawling coalition. The parties won‚Äôt fully exchange their class identities for the simple reason that working-class blacks and Hispanics can‚Äôt trust the GOP to represent them. 
If it doesn‚Äôt diversify and become more accommodating to nonwhites, the GOP will only grow crazier and scarier , and its effort to wield power with the support of a shrinking white base will become even more extreme. {snip}

"During her pregnancy, she never drank alcohol or had a cigarette. But nearly every day, Stacey, then 24, smoked marijuana. With her fianc√©‚Äôs blessing, she began taking a few puffs in her first trimester to quell morning sickness before going to work at a sandwich shop. When sciatica made it unbearable to stand during her   shifts, she discreetly vaped marijuana oil on her lunch break. ‚ÄúI wouldn‚Äôt necessarily say, ‚ÄòGo smoke a pound of pot when you‚Äôre pregnant,‚Äô‚Äù said Stacey, now a    mother in Deltona, Fla. who asked that her full name be withheld because   marijuana is illegal in Florida. ‚ÄúIn moderation, it‚Äôs O. K. ‚Äù Many pregnant women, particularly younger ones, seem to agree, a recent federal survey shows. As states legalize marijuana or its medical use, expectant mothers are taking it up in increasing numbers  ‚Äî   another example of the many ways in which acceptance of marijuana has outstripped scientific understanding of its effects on human health. Often pregnant women presume that cannabis has no consequences for developing infants. But preliminary research suggests otherwise: Marijuana‚Äôs main psychoactive ingredient  ‚Äî   tetrahydrocannabinol, or THC  ‚Äî   can cross the placenta to reach the fetus, experts say, potentially harming brain development, cognition and birth weight. THC can also be present in breast milk. ‚ÄúThere is an increased perception of the safety of cannabis use, even in pregnancy, without data to say it‚Äôs actually safe,‚Äù said Dr. Torri Metz, an obstetrician at Denver Health Medical Center who specializes in   pregnancies. Ten percent of her patients acknowledge recent marijuana use. In the federal  survey, published online in December, almost 4 percent of    said they had used marijuana in the past month in 2014, compared with 2. 4 percent in 2002. (By comparison, roughly 9 percent of pregnant women ages 18 to 44 acknowledge using alcohol in the previous month.) Young    were particularly likely to turn to marijuana: Roughly 7. 5 percent of   to    said they had used pot in the past month in 2014, compared with 2 percent of women ages 26 to 44. Evidence on the effects of prenatal marijuana use is still limited and sometimes contradictory. Some of the most extensive data come from two sets of researchers, in Pittsburgh and in Ottawa, who have long studied children exposed to THC in the womb. In Pittsburgh,    born to mothers who had smoked one joint or more daily in the first trimester showed a decreased ability to understand concepts in listening and reading. At age 10, children exposed to THC in utero were more impulsive than other children and less able to focus their attention. Most troubling, children of mothers who used marijuana heavily in the first trimester had lower scores in reading, math and spelling at age 14 than their peers. ‚ÄúPrenatal exposure can affect the adolescent pretty significantly,‚Äù said Dr. Lauren M. Jansson, the director of pediatrics at the Center for Addiction and Pregnancy at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. Several studies have found changes in the brains of fetuses, 18 to 22 weeks old, linked to maternal marijuana use. In male fetuses who were exposed, for instance, researchers have noted abnormal function of the amygdala, the part of the brain that regulates emotion. ‚ÄúEven early in development, marijuana is changing critical circuits and neurotransmitting receptors,‚Äù said Dr. Yasmin Hurd, a neuroscientist and the director of the addiction center at Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in Manhattan. ‚ÄúThose are important for regulation of emotions and reward, even motor function and cognition. ‚Äù It is already well documented that the developing brains of teenagers can be altered with regular marijuana use, even eventually reducing I. Q. ‚ÄúThe effects are not dramatic, but that doesn‚Äôt mean they are not important,‚Äù said Jodi Gilman, an assistant professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School who studies adolescent users of cannabis. ‚ÄúIt could make the difference between getting an A and getting a B. ‚Äù ‚ÄúYou could imagine that a similar subtle effect may be present in those who were exposed prenatally to marijuana,‚Äù she added. The American Academy of Pediatrics and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists both advise against prenatal cannabis use because of its links to cognitive impairment and academic underachievement. But many state and federal agencies avoid the topic. Of five federal agencies, only the National Institute on Drug Abuse had any information about prenatal marijuana use on its website as of last February, according to a study published online in December in the journal Substance Abuse. Only 10 state health departments did. Until recently, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention offered nothing. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think public health officials should be alarming people,‚Äù said Marian Jarlenski, the study‚Äôs lead author and an assistant professor at the University of Pittsburgh Graduate School of Public Health. ‚ÄúThey just have to say, ‚ÄòThere have been studies done, and there is some risk. ‚Äô‚Äù In a statement, C. D. C. officials expressed concern about memory and attention problems among children exposed to THC in utero. ‚ÄúWhile current evidence on health consequences is inconsistent, some studies have found risks associated with marijuana use during pregnancy, such as low birth weight or preterm birth,‚Äù the agency said. Dr. Marie McCormick, a pediatrician and the chairwoman of a new report on cannabis from the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine, said smoking cannabis ‚Äúdoes confer, in terms of birth weight, the same risk as cigarettes. ‚Äù Some of the gathering evidence is reassuring. So far, prenatal cannabis exposure does not appear to be linked to obvious birth defects. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs why some providers and lay people alike think there‚Äôs no effect,‚Äù said Dr. Erica Wymore, a neonatologist at Children‚Äôs Hospital Colorado. But she warned, ‚ÄúJust because they don‚Äôt have a major birth defect or overt withdrawal symptoms doesn‚Äôt mean the baby‚Äôs neurological development is not impacted. ‚Äù Most research in this area was done when the drug was far less potent. Marijuana had 12 percent THC in 2014, while in 1995 it was just 4 percent, according to the National Institute on Drug Abuse. ‚ÄúAll those really good earlier studies on marijuana effects aren‚Äôt telling us what we need to know now about higher concentration levels,‚Äù said Therese Grant, an epidemiologist and director of the University of Washington‚Äôs fetal alcohol and drug unit. ‚ÄúWe need to do a whole lot more research now. ‚Äù There are two additional problems with studies of maternal cannabis use. Research is often based on reports by pregnant women  ‚Äî   instead of, say, tests of urine or the umbilical cord  ‚Äî   and they consistently underreport their use. (Researchers know of underreporting because samples reveal discrepancies.) And pregnant women who roll joints also tend to smoke tobacco or drink alcohol it can be hard to tease out the risks of cannabis itself. Few realize that THC is stored in fat and therefore can linger in a mother‚Äôs body for weeks, if not months. It‚Äôs not known whether the fetus‚Äôs exposure is limited to the hours a woman feels high. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists advises clinicians to ask pregnant women about marijuana use and to urge them to quit. To find out whether that‚Äôs happening, Dr. Judy Chang, an   at the University of Pittsburgh, and her colleagues recorded more than 450 first visits with pregnant patients. Medical staff were more likely to warn patients that child protective services might be called if they used marijuana, the researchers found, than to advise them of potential risks. When    admitted to marijuana use, almost half of obstetric clinicians did not respond at all. Pregnant women aren‚Äôt eager to discuss it, either, because they are afraid of legal repercussions or a lecture. Depression, anxiety, stress, pain, nausea and vomiting were the most common reasons women reported using marijuana in a 2014 survey of   mothers getting federal nutrition help in Colorado. Roughly 6 percent were pot users a third were pregnant. ‚ÄúWomen are thinking of this as medical marijuana in that they are treating some condition,‚Äù said Elizabeth Nash, a policy analyst at the Guttmacher Institute who researches substance abuse in pregnancy. ‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre going to consider it like medicine,‚Äù she said, ‚Äúthen treat it like medicine and talk to your doctor about it. ‚Äù Stacey‚Äôs son just had his first birthday. He‚Äôs walking, talking and   and she isn‚Äôt worried about his development. She still smokes pot  ‚Äî   indeed, her son plays on a rug emblazoned with a marijuana leaf. But the severe cramps that plagued her before pregnancy are easing now. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt have to smoke as much anymore,‚Äù she said.",Foregin,

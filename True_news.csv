,Foregin,"CAIRO  â€”   In many ways, life is not so bad for Egyptâ€™s deposed ruler, Hosni Mubarak. At the Cairo hospital he calls home, he enjoys regular deliveries of flowers, newspapers and takeout restaurant meals visits from his wife, two sons and grandchildren and a sweeping view over the Nile. To mark his 88th birthday recently, a throng of   gathered at the hospital gates and sang, danced and waved his portrait. Mr. Mubarak pulled open a window and waved back. However, the one luxury Mr. Mubarak has not been afforded is the right to simply walk out of the hospital  â€”   which is something of a conundrum. In May 2015, a judge decreed that Mr. Mubarak had completed his   prison sentence for corruption, in the only successful prosecution of the onetime strongman since his turbulent ouster in 2011. Technically, he was a free man. Yet Mr. Mubarak remains confined to the hospital room that has doubled as a jail cell for the past three years, with a guard posted outside his door. His legal limbo continues even as many of his former allies, men who grew fabulously rich during his three decades of rule, are quietly cutting deals with the government to overturn their own convictions. Mr. Mubarakâ€™s longtime lawyer, Farid   declined interview requests. But several of Mr. Mubarakâ€™s friends, including those who visit him in the hospital, explain the situation as a delicate deal between him and Egyptâ€™s powerful military. They say the military has been generally lenient toward   figures since President Abdel Fattah   took power in 2013, but wants to avoid the likely outcry that would accompany Mr. Mubarakâ€™s release. So the two sides have reached a compromise: Mr. Mubarak agrees to stay in the hospital for now, and the government agrees that his two sons, Alaa, a businessman, and Gamal, once seen as his political heir, will remain free. Both were released from jail last year. â€œHis weak point is his two sons,â€ said Yousri Abdelraziq, a volunteer lawyer for Mr. Mubarak. â€œAnd whenever he speaks in public, the authorities get upset. â€ Mr. Abdelraziq said he had received Mr. Mubarakâ€™s permission before speaking to a journalist and produced a cellphone picture of himself standing beside the former president, looking grumpy inside his hospital room. Security and his medical treatment are other factors in Mr. Mubarakâ€™s hospital stay, friends say. A military spokesman declined to comment on the possibility of an arrangement with Mr. Mubarak. Mr. Mubarakâ€™s legal limbo is a reflection of the curious place he occupies in Egyptian public life, five years after the heady protests that ended his long rule. Many Egyptians still despise him as the totemic symbol of the rampant cronyism and repression that plagued Egypt for decades. His incarceration is one of the last remaining victories for the leaders of the 2011 protests, many of whom are now languishing in Mr. Sisiâ€™s jails. But others have started to look back on Mr. Mubarakâ€™s rule with a twinge of bitter nostalgia, as a time of relative freedom compared with the harsh authoritarianism of Mr. Sisiâ€™s rule. â€œOf course Mubarak was corrupt, but he knew how to take good advice,â€ said Osama Diab, an anticorruption researcher at the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights, a prominent rights group in Cairo. â€œNow itâ€™s a disaster. Mubarak was a competent dictator Sisi is not. â€ As hard feelings toward Mr. Mubarak seem to be receding, so do his legal woes. The humiliations of 2012 and 2013, when he was forced to sit in a courtroom cage, are largely over. He avoided prosecution on the most serious charges, like the deaths of protesters in 2011, and he now faces a retrial in one final case. There is little prospect of it coming to court anytime soon, lawyers say. Instead, Mr. Mubarak is whiling away his days at the Maadi Military Hospital, a towering complex overlooking the Nile. Staff members there say he lives under a permissive yet firm regimen. Security is tight, and all visitors are vetted by the Ministry of Defense, a security official said. He chats on his cellphone (he has an old Nokia model without Internet access) and occasionally receives a barber who dyes his hair. Nurses sometimes see him shuffling the halls as part of therapy for a fractured pelvis he suffered in a fall in the bathroom in 2013. Mr. Mubarak frequently receives flowers from admirers, and visits from his wife, Suzanne, his sons and his grandchildren, and a tight circle of ardent admirers. They say his mood veers from high spirits to embittered grumbling, describing a man who is scornful of the allies who abandoned him, dismissive of the young protesters who pushed him out, and largely unrepentant for his 29 years in power. â€œHe feels betrayed,â€ said Hassan Ghandour, a former Republican Guard who befriended Mr. Mubarak. â€œWhen he sees critics on TV who used to suck up to him, it leaves him very irritated. â€ Maadi Military Hospital has been the stage for other   political dramas. In 1980, the shah of Iran died there, on the floor below Mr. Mubarak, having fled to Egypt from revolutionary Iran. The next year, Egyptâ€™s own ruler, Anwar   was rushed to the hospital after being shot by Islamist officers at a military parade. He died hours later, paving the way for Mr. Mubarak to take over. Mr. Mubarak is very conscious of his own legacy, said Mr. Abdelraziq, the lawyer, and was â€œvery upsetâ€ to be convicted of corruption. He gently nudged his way back into the spotlight last year, giving a rare if unrevealing   phone interview to a television talk show. Shortly afterward, security at his room was tightened. Since Mr. Sisi took power in 2013, the government and courts have shown great leniency toward the powerful figures of Mr. Mubarakâ€™s era  â€”   business tycoons, ministers and cronies, now exonerated or released from jail  â€”   underscoring the sharp limits of change in Egypt since 2011. In the latest case, on May 4, an appeals court overturned a   sentence for corruption against Ahmed Nazif, who served as prime minister under Mr. Mubarak from 2004 to 2011. Others are seeking to buy their freedom with cash payments. A lawyer for Hussein Salem, a billionaire businessman and Mubarak confidant who fled to Spain in 2011, has agreed to transfer 75 percent of his wealth  â€”   5. 5 billion Egyptian pounds, or about $626 million at the official exchange rate  â€”   in exchange for the overturning of two convictions, carrying sentences of seven and 15 years. â€œThe deal is done from our part,â€ said the lawyer, Mahmoud Kebaish. â€œNow we are waiting for the government. â€ Adel   of the Illicit Gains Authority, which handles such deals, said it had received more than 30 settlement requests from businessmen and former officials linked to Mr. Mubarak. Another Illicit Gains Authority official said Mr. Mubarak, too, was hoping to cut a deal, offering about $10 million in return for the quashing of his corruption conviction. That bid is unlikely to succeed soon, and few believe Mr. Mubarak will be heading to his villa in Sharm el Sheikh anytime soon. But short of a full release, he may have an eye on shaping his legacy and overturning his conviction so the state will restore his military honors and ensure a state funeral. â€œWhat matters now about Mubarak is how he goes down in history,â€ said Mr. Diab, the researcher. â€œWhen he dies, the fight will be over whether he was a thief or a military hero, whether he was responsible for the current chaos in Egypt, or whether he saved the country from it until he was kicked out. â€"
,Foregin,"Posted on November 5, 2016 by Eric Zuesse. Eric Zuesse On November 3rd, Morning Consultâ€™s Jon Reid bannered, â€œPoverty on the Rise in Nearly All House Districtsâ€ and he reported that, â€œA Brookings Institution study , released less than a week before the election, shows that the number of people living in poverty has increased in 96 percent of congressional districts between 2000 and 2010-2014.â€ That finding fits along with others, such as that the economic â€˜recoveryâ€™ after Barack Obama came into the White House in 2009, went virtually entirely to the very rich. According to the top experts on wealth-inequality in the United States, Emmanuel Saez and Gabriel Zucman, American wealth-inequality soared faster during 2003-2013 than ever since the period 1923-1928, right before the Great Crash of 1929. Their study â€œWealth Inequality in the United States Since 1913â€ , published in the May 2016 Quarterly Journal of Economics , reported that ever since the remilitarization of the U.S. from the 2003 invasion of Iraq onward (and continuing under Obama, with boosts to NATO, and invasions such as of Libya in 2011), the percentage of total wealth owned by the richest .1% of American families (those families whose net worth was $111 million or higher) rose from 15% of the total in 2003, to 22% of the total in 2013, and this means that the percentage going to the lower 99.9% declined from 85% down to 78% during that time. Americaâ€™s soaring inequality during the George W. Bush Presidency continued unaffected by the 2009 change of Presidential Administrations. In fact: whereas Bushâ€™s stock-market plunge in 2006-2008 hit the richest the hardest, Obamaâ€™s coming into oiffice restored their lost wealth rapidly, while the wealth of the bottom 90% of the U.S. population flatlined throughout his Presidency. The Obama economic recovery was no recovery at all for the bottom 90% of Americans. Not just wealth but personal income also soared for the super-rich under Obama. The â€œShare of income earned by top 0.1% wealth holdersâ€ soared throughout Obamaâ€™s Presidency, at least up through 2012, which is the latest figure shown there for that. So: at least the bottom 90% of U.S. families have experienced none of the Obama economic recovery; what â€˜recoveryâ€™ from the â€˜recessionâ€™ there is, went only to the very rich. Findings such as those are consistent with, and might help to explain, the finding in the new Brookings study, that 96% of House districts have experienced increased poverty under Obama. The nationâ€™s poor have gotten political rhetoric, but not much else, and the middle class also have received no net benefit, under Obama."

Huma Abedin is seeking an immunity deal with the FBI in the wake of James Comeyâ€™s announcement that the agency have reopened their investigation into Hillary Clintonâ€™s use of a private email server. 
Abedin, who serves as vice chairwoman of Hillary Clintonâ€™s 2016 campaign for President, is allegedly seeking the immunity deal so that if she testifies against Clinton and Obama, she will not face prosecution herself. 
According to an FBI insider , Huma has indicated that she would be willing to talk to them as long as they guarantee her immunity. related content"
,Foregin,"The nicest thing I own is the first thing you see when you walk into my house: a red handmade rug bought in Tehran, haggled over in Farsi and delivered, in person, to the Brooklyn apartment of the man who would become my husband. Back then, James told me the woman who gave him the rug, a woman he had recently dated, was by then â€œjust a friend. â€ I didnâ€™t believe men and women could be â€œjust friends. â€ At least not if they were single, with one or both actively seeking a romantic partner. Yet I also agreed to be â€œjust friendsâ€ with James, at first. I was the one who contacted him. We had both joined a dating service called, pretentiously enough, The Right Stuff, after seeing an ad for it in The New Yorker. â€œI liked your profile,â€ he wrote in his first email, â€œbut didnâ€™t contact you because you have a child. â€ At least he didnâ€™t write, as several others had, â€œThank you for being so honest. â€ Itâ€™s a line that makes you ask yourself: How could a mother lie about being a mother? Not ethically, but logistically? Maybe a liar would wait until the man is smitten, then spring the child on him and shout, â€œSurprise!â€ But to what end? I had tried to meet other single parents. I met a man who   about the $   child support his   demanded for his daughtersâ€™ clothing allowance. I met another who asked how much I weighed, as if I were a chicken he was considering for a recipe. Then there was the man who told me about his summer plans to share a house with other singles on Fire Island. â€œDo you do that every year?â€ I asked. He let out of a puff of air. â€œOf course not. Next year Iâ€™ll be married. â€ â€œMarried to who?â€ I asked. â€œI donâ€™t know yet. â€ Meeting my eyes over his mojito, he said, â€œMaybe to you. â€ I also met plenty of nice men with whom I had nothing in common except similar philosophies on effective potty training. So when I saw the Right Stuff ad, I thought: At least someone I meet through an ad in The New Yorker will be someone who reads The New Yorker, and weâ€™d have that to talk about. Maybe I could find a man who reads the arts listings, and maybe even (if I could be this lucky) the poetry and fiction. I did. He was JamesNYC125. I was RedWeather. He responded to my first email: â€œA redheaded editor in Brooklyn  â€”   what could be better? But dating a woman with a child would be complicated, as Iâ€™m sure you know. â€ I did. â€œLetâ€™s not date,â€ he suggested. â€œLetâ€™s just get together as friends. â€ That summer we both had travel plans, so a whole month passed before our first date  â€”   or our first â€œplaydate,â€ I guess. In the meantime, we emailed every day. I sent him poems. He sent me music. Even while discussing academic publishing, from my side as an editor and his as a researcher, we couldnâ€™t help flirting. An economist, he would answer a question with: â€œProbability of 1. â€ â€œI love it when you talk math talk,â€ Iâ€™d say. And he would reply, â€œI can do it any time you want. â€ Our first meeting was on Smith Street. We talked books, then strolled to BookCourt, slid a novel off the shelf and read passages aloud. His timing was perfect, his voice what Iâ€™d hoped it would be from the emails. â€œIâ€™d love to walk with you on the promenade,â€ he said, and then sneezed. â€œBut I should nurse my cold. â€ I wanted to nurse his cold, too. I wanted to boil him a pot of   tea and kiss him. Later I did, leaning against a car parked at a meter outside an elementary school. We both pretended I hadnâ€™t. The next morning, he called to ask me to a modern dance performance in two weeks. We both lived in Brooklyn but met, for the second time, in Manhattan. His hand grazed my thigh in the dark, a moment I would replay over and over in my head. For our third   I suggested attending a concert on a barge docked near the Brooklyn Heights Promenade. Our knees touched in our cozy seats two rows from the string quartet. Next we hiked Bear Mountain. â€œI didnâ€™t think a skinny girl like you could outpace me,â€ he said. Then later: â€œIâ€™m only letting you walk ahead so I can get a good view from back here. â€ So I vamped my hips. When we removed our hiking boots and socks in the car, we stared at each otherâ€™s naked feet.   No. 5 was dinner at my place. Back then, the nicest thing I owned was also the first thing you saw when you entered: a red futon couch. I chose the cover from the remnants section of a fabric store on the Lower East Side. It was something I could unzip and clean whenever a child spit up, spilled Cheerios or wiped peanut butter on it. When I pulled a book off the shelf to show James, the PokÃ©mon cards I used for bookmarks fell out. Later, we found ourselves in bed. Finally. And thatâ€™s when he confessed, â€œIâ€™m dating someone else. â€ She was a fellow economist he had met at a conference around the same time he met me, an   who lived in Washington, D. C. â€œNow you tell me?â€ â€œYou knew we could only be friends. â€ â€œYou have sex with all your friends?â€ I removed his hand from my belly. â€œI bet she doesnâ€™t even know about me. â€ I told him we had to either date or not see each other again. We were both traveling for Thanksgiving, so we decided not to email or phone until we returned home. Then he would call and tell me which woman he chose. Somehow I had turned myself into a   contestant, a   version of one of those â€œBachelorâ€ shows my friends watch. I flew to Austin, Tex. to share the holiday with my brother. â€œIâ€™ve met the one,â€ I said. â€œJust because it sounds corny doesnâ€™t mean it isnâ€™t true. â€ â€œDoes he feel the same way?â€ my brother asked. I asked myself that question from the time I woke up until the time I went to bed, and sometimes in the middle of the night, too. James and I had emailed every day for months, long letters detailing our whole lives. I kept checking my inbox in Austin, though I knew it would come up empty. On the flight home, I tried to imagine my competitor. She grew up in the center of an ancient civilization. I grew up in Detroit. Her furniture probably smelled like an exotic perfume, not peanut butter. She was not a single mother. He had already informed me about how complicated dating a single mother could be. Did I even have a chance? Trying to think like a statistician, I put my odds at  . Or, as an economist would say: probability 0. 5. Minutes after I arrived home, James called. â€œI choose you,â€ he said. I dropped the phone and fell onto the bare floor. Weeks later, he buzzed me up to his apartment. The door opened to reveal the most beautiful rug I had ever seen, so finely woven it was more like a tapestry. The kind of precious object that could be ruined by a few stray Cheerios crumbs. â€œItâ€™s a gift from a friend,â€ he said. â€œShe bought it when she visited her family in Iran. â€ â€œSheâ€™s trying to get you back,â€ I said. â€œWhat? Sheâ€™s just being kind. Donâ€™t you love it?â€ â€œSure. â€ I loved imagining what I would do to it after it collected enough dust. Iâ€™d take it outside, hang it   and beat it with a stick. But James turned out to be right. Sometimes a rug is just a rug. And sometimes men and women can be friends, even after they have been romantically involved. Rug Woman never tried to win him back. Time passed, and I asked James if he ever wished he had chosen her. â€œNo,â€ he said. â€œYouâ€™re perfect for me. â€ Right. I wasnâ€™t the kind of person who would fantasize about walloping a beautiful rug. At least I wasnâ€™t anymore. Months later, James met my son, Jonah. I cooked Jonahâ€™s favorite, â€œchicken with crumbs,â€ and after our dessert of apple crisp, we played Clue. The next day, Jonah asked, â€œCan I have another playdate with my new friend?â€ â€œWhich one?â€ â€œJames. â€ Now we share the rug. It holds a place of honor in the house James and I bought together. We wipe our feet on the porch before crossing the threshold, food is banned from the entryway, and I vacuum it with care. I treat the rug as we all deserve to be treated. Like a friend."
,Foregin,"In preparation for the scheduled 2018 launch of their Starliner spacecraft, Boeing has unveiled an innovative redesign of the traditional astronautâ€™s space suit.[  In the service of crawling out from beneath Russiaâ€™s current monopoly on spaceflight, NASA contractors Boeing and SpaceX continue to push toward the completion of   American craft. And while both are working hard on their respective rocket designs, Boeing was eager to demonstrate another vital element of the mission: The next generation of space suit. The â€œBoeing Blueâ€ suit is leaner, lighter, more mobile, and sports quality of life improvements across the board. Crew and Mission Systems Director Chris Ferguson explained, â€œAstronauts had formerly had these relatively bulky, heavy suits with thick neck rings. And we learned throughout the years that maybe we didnâ€™t need that. â€ The new suit has been â€œsimplified,â€ replacing the sealed   with a heavy   zipper, and adding breathable mesh beneath the surface to maximize comfort, mobility, and airflow. They are offering â€œpressurized mobility, while still preserving unpressurized comfort. â€ Its gloves have been enhanced with special material on the palms and two of the fingers to allow for â€œcapacitativeâ€ touch screen interaction. That means that astronauts can now interact with their capsuleâ€™s advanced touch interfaces, without leaving the protection of the suit. Itâ€™s also much lighter. While current space suits come in at a hefty 33 lbs, the Boeing design is barely 12. Ferguson claims that you can lie in the cockpit without any real need for external cooling, and it is comfortable enough to stand around in without developing an uncomfortable â€œheat load. â€ The boots are â€œbreathable and slip resistant,â€ and zippers on the torso have been designed to make it easier for a suited individual to â€œcomfortably transition between sitting and standing. â€ And, of course, the head provides     communications built right in, and significant improvements to peripheral vision. Despite the current  â€”   and somewhat convoluted  â€”   challenge of getting our intrepid men and women into space right now, weâ€™re finally getting on track for a return to the forefront of   tech. And weâ€™re doing it in style. Follow Nate Church @Get2Church on Twitter for the latest news in gaming and technology, and snarky opinions on both."
,Foregin,"  Donald J. Trump overhauled his transition team from top to bottom on Friday, expanded his outreach to more establishment Republicans, and even offered an olive branch to President Obama  â€”   albeit a narrow one. On the other side, Democrats signaled they would move left in the wake of Hillary Clintonâ€™s    defeat, and the  â€™s legal antagonist, Gloria Allred, made it clear that neither she nor many of the women who have accused him of sexual assault are going anywhere. Join us again on Monday for continuing live updates on the transition to the 45th presidency of the United States. Mr. Trump said Friday that, after talking with President Obama this week, he might be willing to leave in place parts of the Affordable Care Act once heâ€™s in office. Mr. Trump made the comments to The Wall Street Journal in his first interview since winning the election. The newspaper said Mr. Obama had urged the   to reconsider repealing his signature health care law, which Mr. Trump said had become â€œunworkable. â€ But in the interview, Mr. Trump said he told the president that he would consider keeping two provisions of the law: the prohibition against insurers denying coverage because of a patientâ€™s   condition and the one that allows parents to keep their children on their insurance plans until they turn 26. The problem: Without a mandate for everyone to buy health insurance, the popular   condition provision could send insurance companies into a tailspin, because their costs would rise with sicker customers, and that would not be offset by healthy consumers forced to buy insurance. Mr. Trump said in an interview to be shown on â€œ60 Minutesâ€ Sunday that Mrs. Clinton â€œcouldnâ€™t have been nicerâ€ in a congratulatory call she made to concede the election, and that Bill Clinton had complimented him on â€œone of the most amazingâ€ presidential runs he had ever seen. â€œIt was a lovely call, and it was a tough call for her  â€”   I mean, I can imagine, tougher for her than it would have been for me,â€ Mr. Trump said. â€œShe couldnâ€™t have been nicer. She just said, â€˜Congratulations, Donald, well done. â€™â€ Mr. Trump, who on Thursday said he would seek Mr. Obamaâ€™s counsel about the presidency, said he would consider asking for Mr. Clintonâ€™s as well. Mr. Trump also promised that there would be no lapse in health insurance for millions of Americans covered under the Affordable Care Act when he repeals and replaces the law. â€œWeâ€™re going to do it simultaneously  â€”   itâ€™ll be just fine,â€ Mr. Trump said. â€œThatâ€™s what I do. I do a good job. You know, I mean, I know how to do this stuff. Weâ€™re going to repeal it and replace it. And weâ€™re not going to have, like, a   period and weâ€™re not going to have a   period where thereâ€™s nothing. â€ Mr. Trump has quietly reached out to Mitt Romney, the 2012 Republican nominee who took an impassioned stand against Mr. Trump during the campaign. The call came after Mr. Trumpâ€™s surprise victory on Tuesday night, according to two people briefed on it, although it was unclear how it went and what was said. Aides to Mr. Trump and Mr. Romney did not respond to requests for comment. With her eye on the rightâ€™s Paula Jones legal crusade of the 1990s, Gloria Allred, the civil rights lawyer representing women who have accused Mr. Trump of sexual assault, is trying to lure the   into a legal battle before he takes office. Ms. Allred challenged Mr. Trump on Friday to retract his threat to sue his accusers for defaming him and suggested that she might bring a case against him if he refused. She also said that she was prepared to countersue if Mr. Trump made good on the threat. â€œ  Trump now has the opportunity to act presidential,â€ Ms. Allred said at a news conference with Summer Zervos, the former contestant on â€œThe Apprenticeâ€ who said last month that Mr. Trump tried to seduce her and grabbed her breasts in 2007. Ms. Allred cited a precedent for suing a sitting president: Ms. Jones. â€œObviously the lawsuit against President Clinton by Paula Jones did proceed while he was in office for actions that were alleged to take place prior to his becoming president,â€ she said. The Jones case forced Mr. Clinton into a deposition that resulted in his impeachment on charges of lying under oath about an affair with an intern. A sobbing Ms. Zervos sat next to Ms. Allred and offered her own solution: â€œWhat happened to a good,   Iâ€™m sorry?â€ Vice   Mike Pence will take the lead on the  â€™s transition. Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey, who is under a cloud after two aides were convicted of conspiring to shut down traffic on the George Washington Bridge in the   Bridgegate scandal, moves aside. Mr. Trump told advisers that he wanted Mr. Penceâ€™s Washington experience and contacts. An executive committee, which will include members of Congress, will advise Mr. Pence as the process moves forward. See the full story. Corey Lewandowski, who was fired as Mr. Trumpâ€™s campaign manager and then went to work for CNN, even as he continued to consult with the campaign, resigned Friday from his political commentator role, the network confirmed. Mr. Lewandowski is expected to take a position in the Trump administration. He was seen in Trump Tower on Wednesday immediately after Mr. Trumpâ€™s victory, chatting with senior aides and attending meetings. Mr. Lewandowski did not return calls for comment. Mr. Lewandowski was viewed as a controversial appointment by the network he had signed a nondisclosure agreement with Mr. Trump that prevented him from criticizing the candidate publicly, and he was still being paid by the campaign while working for CNN. Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the incoming Democratic leader, threw his weight behind Representative Keith Ellison of Minnesota on Friday to be the new chairman of the Democratic National Committee, the clearest sign yet that, in defeat, the party will move to the left. After losing the   Rust Belt to Mr. Trump, Democrats could have recruited an   populist like Representative Tim Ryan of Ohio, who represents the Youngstown area. But Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont quickly backed Mr. Ellison, who is black, Muslim and an ardent progressive. Two former governors, Howard Dean of Vermont and Martin Oâ€™Malley of Maryland, also expressed interest Friday in being the partyâ€™s new committee chairman. So much for a warm welcome to Washington. Groups on social media are trying to coordinate a Million Woman March the day after Mr. Trumpâ€™s inauguration in protest of the new president. The march will go from the Lincoln Memorial to the White House on Jan. 21 to show â€œstrength, power and courage. â€ Men are also encouraged to attend. â€œNo woman is free unless all women are free,â€ the organizers of the march wrote on the Facebook page where it is being organized. State groups for the march have already been formed for people to coordinate travel to the capital. However, some fear that the idea could become a logistical nightmare coming so close to Inauguration Day because of the lack of hotel rooms and the potential for clashes with Trump supporters Among the  â€™s most pressing questions as he prepares to take office is where he should live. Mr. Trump, a provincial homebody who divides his time among golf courses in Florida and New Jersey and his townhouse apartment in Manhattan, is weighing how much time to spend in Washington, according to two people familiar with his deliberations. One option is spending weekends in New York and most of the week in Washington. Mr. Trumpâ€™s wife, Melania, is ultimately planning to move to Washington, according to one person briefed on the discussions, but their    son, Barron, is still in school. Mr. Trump may be triumphant, but Gloria Allred isnâ€™t done with him yet. More than 10 women accused Mr. Trump of sexual assault after a video bragging about his groping habits emerged last month. Ms. Allred, the lawyer who has been working with many of the women, does not appear to be letting the   off the hook. At 2:30 p. m. Eastern time on Friday, she said that she was going to issue a challenge to Mr. Trump at a news conference with one of his accusers who has already come out publicly to tell her story. Ms. Allred would not reveal the name of the woman before the event or share any details of the challenge. Before the election, Mr. Trump said that the accusers were all lying and that he might sue them. Ms. Allred told ABC News on Thursday that her clients had no plans to sue Mr. Trump at this point, but that they would countersue if he did so. Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the departing Democratic leader, added his voice to the postelection statements on the  . Unlike most Democrats, he gave no quarter: Some of the   protesters who have taken to the streets this week are supporters of Mr. Sanders, and on Friday the former Democratic presidential candidate reminded them that creating chaos and disorder should not be their goal. Trump Tower, the skyscraper on Fifth Avenue and the home base of the   has become a fortress in the wake of the election. The lobby, designated a public space by the City of New York, was closed off on Friday morning as Mr. Trump met with advisers. A large police presence surrounded the building. The tower was built with a special permit more than 30 years ago. The city granted Mr. Trump extra space in exchange for maintaining public access to the lobby. Peter Thiel, the Silicon Valley libertarian who secretly financed a lawsuit against the website Gawker, was named a member of the Presidential Transition Team Executive Committee on Friday afternoon."
,Foregin,"The Washington Post tried to compare Sen. Elizabeth Warrenâ€™s speech being stopped after she attacked Attorney General Jeff Sessions and broke the rules in the Senate this week to Breitbart Senior Editor MILOâ€™s    at UC Berkeley last week in an opinion piece citing the Streisand Effect. [â€œWhatâ€™s the best way to make sure a message gets heard? Try to muzzle it,â€ declared The Washington Postâ€˜s Catherine Rampell on Thursday. â€œBoth liberals and conservatives are newly rediscovering the political power of this phenomenon, known as the Streisand Effect. The term refers to what happens when an attempt to censor information backfires and instead unintentionally draws more attention to the censorship target. â€  â€œAfter all, suppression of speech not only generates more public interest, as bystanders scramble to learn what all the fuss is about it can also win the speaker sympathy and the moral high ground,â€ explained Rampell, before comparing Sen. Elizabeth Warrenâ€™s attempt to suggest Jeff Sessions was a racist before his confirmation as attorney general to MILOâ€™s Berkeley event, which was violently shut down by   rioters. â€œThe riots didnâ€™t silence Yiannopoulos, however instead, the resulting coverage megaphoned his ugly message to a much broader audience and will help him sell more books, schedule more lucrative speaking gigs and receive more sympathetic tweets from our sitting president. â€ Throughout the piece, Rampell failed to go into detail on why Warren, who was stopped from speaking after she broke Senate rules and falsely branded Sessions as a racist, was remotely similar to MILO, who was forced to evacuate UC Berkeley after violent rioters started several fires, smashed up buildings and ATMs, assaulted numerous attendees, and attacked cars passing by. â€œThere are many compelling arguments for why protecting free speech, including speech you disagree with or even abhor, is important,â€ concluded Rampell. â€œBut one underappreciated argument is  . Forcibly silencing and thereby martyring your opponents  â€”   rather than employing   to expose them as wrong or, better yet, ridiculous  â€”   may be exactly what they want you to do. â€ Whereas Warren clearly broke the rules of the Senate by slandering Sessions, and was thus punished and not unfairly silenced, MILO was violently stopped from delivering a speech at a college he was invited to. MILO was also threatened with more violence by   activists should he return to Berkeley to deliver his speech, while Warren, as far as Breitbart News is aware, has not been violently threatened by fellow senators should she return to the Senate."
,Foregin,"CHATTANOOGA, Tenn.  â€”   Jasmine Mateen was standing outside her home here on Tuesday afternoon when her cellphone went off: Two of her daughters, who were injured when their school bus crashed on Monday, were being discharged from the hospital. The news pulled her briefly from her grief. Moments before, Ms. Mateen had been talking about her    daughter Zyaira, the girl with the new   coat, who died in the same bus crash that injured two of Ms. Mateenâ€™s other daughters. â€œMy babyâ€™s coming home, but her sisterâ€™s dead,â€ Ms. Mateen said as a single tear rolled down her left cheek. â€œEven though she was the one who told me my baby was dead, I just didnâ€™t want to believe it,â€ she said of her other    Zasmyn. The third daughter on board, Zacaureeâ€™A Brown, is 10. â€œI couldnâ€™t believe it. You know how you try to hold on to hope?â€ This city, just north of Tennesseeâ€™s border with Georgia, reeled on Tuesday as it coped with the grim toll of the deadly school bus crash. The authorities said that at least five Woodmore Elementary School students  â€”   four girls and a boy  â€”   had died, and that 12 others were still hospitalized. Six of the children were in intensive care. Elsewhere in Chattanooga, the bus driver, Johnthony K. Walker, 24, was jailed and charged with vehicular homicide after the authorities said he had recklessly sped and swerved during his afternoon route. â€œWe are heartbroken for all of our students and their families,â€ said Kirk Kelly, the interim schools superintendent in Hamilton County. â€œYesterday was the worst day that we have had for Woodmore and for Hamilton County Schools that I can recall in my life as an educator and as a parent and as a member of this community. â€ Three of the students who died were in the fourth grade. The other children who were killed were in kindergarten and first grade, Dr. Kelly said, but he did not identify the students. â€œThey will always be with us throughout our lives,â€ he said. â€œThis is something that we will never forget here as a community. â€ The bus was removed from the scene on Tuesday, and crews worked along the blocked street to restore the utility pole that the police said Mr. Walker had struck. A small memorial of stuffed animals and flowers took shape, and investigators reviewed the crash site. The National Transportation Safety Board opened an investigation, and it will be months before federal officials reach any conclusions. But the Chattanooga authorities moved quickly to assign blame, and in an arrest affidavit issued on Tuesday, a police officer wrote that Mr. Walker had been driving â€œat a high rate of speed, well above the posted speed limit of 30 m. p. h. â€ Eventually, the police said, Mr. Walker â€œlost control of the busâ€ and swerved off the narrow roadway. The bus, which ultimately landed on its side, struck a mailbox, an elevated driveway, a tree and a telephone pole. The officer, explaining the decision to charge Mr. Walker with vehicular homicide and other crimes, cited â€œthe reckless natureâ€ of his driving, as well as â€œhis very high speed and weaving within his lane. â€ Tests for drugs and alcohol are pending, Chief Fred Fletcher of the Chattanooga Police Department said in an interview on Tuesday. Federal investigators say they expect to interview Mr. Walker, who received his commercial driverâ€™s license in April and was involved in a minor bus crash in September. Mr. Walkerâ€™s employer, Durham School Services, which holds a contract to bus thousands of Hamilton County students each day, said in a statement that it was â€œdevastated by the accident. â€ The statement did not address questions about the companyâ€™s hiring practices, nor did it respond to reports that parents, including Ms. Mateen, had complained about Mr. Walker. A criminal history report from the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation indicated that Mr. Walker had no arrests before the crash on Monday, but State Department of Safety and Homeland Security records showed that his license was suspended briefly in 2014 for an insurance violation. No one answered the door at Mr. Walkerâ€™s apartment on Tuesday morning, when a woman who said she was a   tried to slip a note under his door. The safety record of Durham, which is based near Chicago and says it transports more than a million schoolchildren in communities around the country each day, was also under scrutiny on Tuesday. A federal regulator, in statistics published late last month, said the company had received 10 â€œdriver fitness violationsâ€ over the course of two years  â€”   a figure better than only a fraction of other similarly sized transportation companies. The federal Department of Transportation said Durhamâ€™s drivers had been involved in 346 accidents in two years, but the statistics did not distinguish whether the companyâ€™s employees were to blame for the wrecks. And although federal officials had flagged Durham for its record on driver fitness, the company had not drawn special attention for a history of unsafe driving. The Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration said the company had a â€œsatisfactoryâ€ safety rating. A company spokeswoman did not respond to emailed questions, but the chairman of the National Transportation Safety Board, Christopher A. Hart, said the panel would look into the company during its investigation. Student fatalities aboard school buses are rare in the United States, where an estimated 25 million children use them daily. In a May report that examined crash data between 2005 and 2014, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said that 53   children had died in accidents while they were riding in what the government classified as â€œschool transportation vehicles. â€ Emotions were raw on Tuesday outside Woodmore, where Demetrius Jenkins stood around daybreak and thought about how he had not yet told his son about the crash. â€œI donâ€™t know how to explain it,â€ Mr. Jenkins said while students ran, walked and skipped toward the school for their final day of classes before Thanksgiving break. The school district said that about 100 of Woodmoreâ€™s approximately 315 students were in their classrooms on Tuesday. The crash occurred about 16 months after a gunman opened fire at two military sites in Chattanooga, killing five servicemen. â€œFive is a cursed number in our city right now, and so we are again dealing with unimaginable loss,â€ Mayor Andy Berke said. â€œThe most unnatural thing in the world is for a parent to mourn the loss of a child. There are no words that can bring comfort to a mother or a father. â€"

,Foregin,"Eleven years ago, Lonnie G. Bunch III was a museum director with no museum. No land. No building. Not even a collection. He had been appointed to lead the nascent National Museum of African American History and Culture. The concept had survived a bruising, racially charged congressional battle that stretched back decades and finally ended in 2003 when President George W. Bush authorized a national museum dedicated to the   experience. Now all Mr. Bunch and a team of colleagues had to do was find an unprecedented number of private donors willing to finance a public museum. They had to secure hundreds of millions of additional dollars from a Congress, Republican controlled, that had long fought the project. And they had to counter efforts to locate the museum not at the center of Washingtonâ€™s cultural landscape on the National Mall, but several blocks offstage. â€œI knew it was going to be hard, but not how hard it was going to be,â€ Mr. Bunch, 63, said in an interview last month. In less than three weeks, though, with President Obama presiding, the new museum, a project that once thirsted for money, land and political support, is scheduled to open on the Mall. Visitors to the $540 million building, designed to resemble a   crown, will encounter the sweeping history of black America from the Middle Passage of slavery to the achievements and complexities of modern black life. But also compelling is the story of how the museum itself came to be through a combination of negotiation, diplomacy, persistence and cunning political instincts. The strategy included an approach that framed the museum as an institution for all Americans, one that depicted the black experience, as Mr. Bunch often puts it, as â€œthe quintessential American storyâ€ of measured progress and remarkable achievement after an ugly period of painful oppression. The tactics included the appointment of Republicans like Laura Bush and Colin L. Powell to the museumâ€™s board to broaden bipartisan support beyond Democratic constituencies, and there were critical efforts to shape the thinking of essential political leaders. Long before its building was complete, for example, the museum staged exhibitions   some on the fraught topics it would confront, such as Thomas Jeffersonâ€™s deep involvement with slavery. A Virginia delegation of congressional members was brought through for an early tour of the Jefferson exhibition, which featured a statue of him in front of a semicircular wall marked with 612 names of people he had owned. â€œI remember being very impacted,â€ said Eric Cantor, then the House Republican leader, who was part of the delegation. Mr. Bunch said that he hoped the Jefferson exhibition   criticism by establishing the museumâ€™s bold but balanced approach to difficult material. â€œSome people were like, â€˜How dare you equate Jefferson with slavery,â€™â€ he recalled. â€œBut it means that people are going to say, â€˜Of course, that is what they have to do. â€™â€ And the museum began an exceptional effort to raise money from black donors, not only celebrities, like Michael Jordan ($5 million) and Oprah Winfrey ($21 million) but also churches, sororities and fraternities, which, Mr. Bunch said, had never been asked for big donations before. Nearly   of the gifts from individuals were from  . An unusually high amount  â€”   $4 million  â€”   came from average people in gifts of less than $1, 000. â€œWe were able to raise a level of awareness that really galvanized people to make small contributions,â€ said Kenneth I. Chenault, the chief executive of American Express, who led the capital campaign. â€œBased on their income level, some of them on a percentage basis were significant. â€ The Alfred Street Baptist Church, in Alexandria, Va. donated $1 million to the museum, while three couples who belong to the church gave individual contributions totaling an additional $4 million. â€œThere is no doubt that we knew you couldnâ€™t build this with   money alone,â€ Mr. Bunch said, â€œbut we also know that there was much more money in this community than most cultural institutions had ever tapped. â€ The idea of a national   museum had been hatched more than a century ago by black Civil War veterans. It picked up a bit of steam in Congress in the 1980s, led by Representative John Lewis, Democrat of Georgia, who joined the efforts of Mickey Leland, the Texas Democrat. For 15 years, though, a bill to create the museum was defeated. â€œOnce Congress gives the go ahead for â€ Senator Jesse Helms, an opponent, warned in a 1994 speech on the Senate floor, â€œhow can Congress then say no to Hispanics, and the next group, and the next group after that?â€ But in 2003, after winning support from Republicans like Senator Sam Brownback of Kansas, the museum escaped from the congressional back burner. â€œThe   community has had a particularly difficult road in the United States,â€ Mr. Brownback, who is now governor of Kansas, said in an interview. â€œIt was time. â€ Even with congressional and presidential support, the battle to find a spot on the Mall dragged on. Congress had rejected a site near the Capitol. Critics said the Mall was already too crowded. The World War II Memorial had only opened there in 2004. â€œIt was bad timing,â€ said Judge Robert L. Wilkins, who led the   committee on a commission that made recommendations to Congress. He and other museum supporters ultimately argued successfully to the Smithsonianâ€™s Board of Regents that a prime location would, among other things, guarantee the most visitors and the most   success. In 2006, the Regents chose a   site on the Mall near the Washington Monument. Private   had to be much more of a concern for this federal museum, the 19th in the Smithsonian portfolio. Its predecessors had received public funds for all or most of their building costs. But the legislation that created the   museum authorized the government to pay for only half. Mr. Bunch had to raise the other $270 million from private donors. Foundations helped with major gifts, and the museum identified companies likely to give. Some had expressed an interest in diversity or were led by people familiar to the museumâ€™s board. Mr. Bunch made hundreds of trips to meet donors. His pitch: â€œYou donâ€™t get a chance to build a national museum every day. â€ The private money was crucial in securing funds from Congress, officials said. It showed politicians how seriously their constituents were taking the museum. A membership program that has become one of the most popular in the Smithsonian demonstrated public support from individual congressional districts. Also crucial, multiple people said, was the canny persistence of Mr. Bunch, who had intimate experience with Chicago politics and who had honed his skills as a facilitator while president of the historical society there. Those skills helped him when he turned to the byzantine entanglements of the Smithsonian, of Washington and of the federal government. â€œYou cannot be a director at a place like the Smithsonian without being political,â€ Mr. Bunch said. He made allies on the Hill before asking them for money. His first supporters were friends from Chicago, like Senator Dick Durbin, and then others, like Representative James E. Clyburn of South Carolina. â€œHe has a really good demeanor for a particularly touchy subject in the United States,â€ said Governor Brownback. â€œHe needed to have an optimistic outlook. This is not about retribution. â€ To maintain   momentum, the museum tried to exist in some fashion long before the construction materials had even been delivered. â€œWe had to be real from the very beginning,â€ Mr. Bunch said, so that people would understand that the museum was not a dream but inevitable. So the museum put out books, asked IBM to create a website, and staged exhibitions at the National Museum of American History. One of the first, in 2009, focused on the Scurlock family of black Washington photographers. Beyond land and money, the new museum needed things to show and a building to show them in. No Smithsonian museum had ever started life without a collection. The museumâ€™s team collected artifacts from around the nation in an â€œAntiques Roadshowâ€  program in 15 cities called â€œSave Our African American Treasures. â€ The program yielded many of the 40, 000 objects the museum now holds  â€”   3, 500 will be exhibited when the building opens  â€”   and elevated the museumâ€™s profile. For the design of their new home, museum officials created a selection committee and displayed the final six plans at the Smithsonian Castle in an effort to be transparent about the process. The winning design, by a team led by the   British architect David Adjaye, spoke of â€œuplift, resiliency and spirituality,â€ Mr. Bunch said, and the bronze color gave the building the symbolism he sought. â€œI love the notion of a darker building,â€ he said, adding: â€œThereâ€™s always been a dark presence in America. There have always been   in this country shaping it whose story gets overlooked or undervalued. â€ It was also a vast departure from some of the design proposals he had been sent within days of his appointment as director in 2005. One envisioned a building shaped like a   fist, hardly appropriate for the museum he foresaw or that Congress had agreed to finance. He quickly moved on to other options. â€œI knew what I didnâ€™t want,â€ he said."
